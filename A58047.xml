            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Chriſtian Reader.</head>
            <p>P<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rpoſing ſome Improvement of Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the late mournful year, when death was ſo largely commiſſioned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy by that dreadful Peſtilence, I made choice of this excellent Subject of Divine Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The beſt way of thinking and mind-employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is this Meditation.</p>
            <p>The right Art and Skill of it, is a rare at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</p>
            <p>The due Practice of it, is a moſt noble ſelf-entertainment.</p>
            <p>A pious Heart hath three happy ways of ſelf-entertainment in ſolitary; three rare ways of being leaſt alone, when moſt alone.</p>
            <p>The firſt way of ſelf-entertainment, is the Ordinance of reading and ſearching the Holy Scriptures, the pure, perfect, and infallible Word and Will of Chriſt concerning us. There Chriſt hath prepared his rich feaſt of fat things full of marrow, and his Royal Banquet of heavenly Truths. There he ſets forth the great varieties of ſure Directions, precious Promiſes, high Examples, rare Experiences,
<pb facs="tcp:47560:3"/>and the help of all his holy Ordinances to feed and ſatiate the hungry and thirſty ſpirit.</p>
            <p>The ſecond way of ſelf-entertainment, is Divine Meditation, by either pondering of ſpiritual things, for improving knowledge, and exciting practice; or by a weighing all other things whatever, for reducing them to a ſpiritual end and uſe.</p>
            <p>The third way of ſelf-entertainment, is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Praying, ſuch as is both bottom'd and bounded by Chriſts will in his Word; ſuch as is both prepared and aſſiſted, made wiſe and warm by ſerious Meditation.</p>
            <p>Meditation ſtands between the two Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Reading and Praying, as the grand Improver of the former, and the high Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the latter, to furniſh the mind with choice materials for prayer, and to fill the heart with holy fervency in it.</p>
            <p>The Naturaliſts obſerve, that to uphold and accommodate bodily life, there are divers ſorts of faculties communicated, and theſe among the reſt.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>1.</hi> An attractive faculty to aſſume and draw in the food.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>2.</hi> A retentive faculty to keep it, being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>3.</hi> An aſſimilating faculty to concoct the nouriſhment.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>4.</hi> An augmenting faculty for drawing to perſection.</item>
            </list>
            <pb facs="tcp:47560:3"/>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Meditation is as the attractive faculty to help to aſſume and take in ſpiritual food. This it doth by helping to act Judgment, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Faith, to ponder, diſcern, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit the things which Reading and Hearing ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies and furniſhes.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> It is like the retaining faculty, by aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and corroborating the memory, helping to lock up the Jewels of divine Truths ſure in that Treaſury.</p>
            <p>Meditation makes a rational memory of things, which is the ſureſt.</p>
            <p>There is in man a ſenſitive memory, in which he participates with ſenſitive Natures, ſuch as beaſts, they have a kind of memory. There is alſo an intellectual or rational memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, wherein man partakes of the like Nature with Angels, they have their faculty of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Meditation ſuperadds to the ſenſitive me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, the help alſo of a rational memory, whereby ſpiritual things are ſecured as under double lock: what we rationally remember, is beſt remembred.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> It is like the aſſimilating or digeſting power, by helping to concoct ſpiritual food, and turn it into ſpiritual nouriſhment. This it helps to effect, by being inſtrumental to work things more powerfully on the will, in a free choice, firm purpoſe, and ready obedience of the excellent Truths of Chriſt; and likewiſe
<pb facs="tcp:47560:4"/>by working on and into the affections of love, joy, and the reſt to cleave unto, and be infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med towards the things of Chriſt. A ſpiritual digeſtion is not by head-work, but heart-work, when the will deliberately and reſolvedly chuſes, and the affections earneſtly embrace heavenly things. Meditation highly conduces to this ſpiritual digeſtion by its pondering, propoſing, and edging efficaciouſly, ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and incentives as work the heart into compliance and obedience.</p>
            <p>It is like, laſtly, the augmenting and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faculty, to help the good heart to grow bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſhoot up higher Heaven-ward. There is one creature, the Crocodile only, which is ſaid to grow all its life time; ſo muſt the true Chriſtian do. Natural things grow by new aſſumed nouriſhment, acted upon by the inward growing power. The real godly man hath an inward growing power implanted by the new life given to him: But this, as by other means, ſo by frequent Meditation, is much aſſiſted, and carried on. Meditation waters and cheriſhes the plants of heavenly graces. It helps them to root deeper, ſhoot higher, and grow ſtronger. Such Chriſtians as meditate moſt, will grow moſt, be growing to the end.</p>
            <p>What in all Christianity is there, that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation is not a furtherance to?</p>
            <p>That ſaying is excellent, worthy of dueſt
<pb facs="tcp:47560:4"/>weighing: <hi>Intellectus cogitabundus, eſt principium omnis boni;</hi> The meditating mind is the beginner of all goodneſs. On a ſinners part it is the riſe of his initial returning to God, of his firſt converting, <hi>Ezek. 18.28.</hi> In the Saints and perſons converted, it is their way to progreſſive converting and renewed repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Pſal. 119.59. I conſidered my ways and turned, &amp;c.</hi> The more conſideration, the more converſion. The great inlet of mans firſt Apoſtacy (beſides infidelity and pride) was his incogitancy. Our firſt Parents loſt all for want of due thinking; not for the want of acting imagination, or any thinking; that could not be; but for want of that conſideration which ſhould have been. They did not conſider all things to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>The overflowings of impiety, aggravated by impenitency, and mens ruſhings into ſin ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly and boldly, have been greatly from want of conſideration. <hi>Jer. 8.6. No man repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of his wickedneſs, ſaying, What have I done? Every one turns to his courſe as the horſe ruſheth into the battel.</hi> Their not returnings were from neglect of ſelf-reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. In any Nation when God intends to work great returnings, he ſtirs up that people to ſelf-bethinkings, <hi>1 Kings 8.47. If they ſhall bethink themſelves.</hi> He minds them of conſidering, to bring them to returning, So a
<pb facs="tcp:47560:5"/>particular perſon, when he firſt comes in to God, he comes firſt to himſelf, and that is by conſideration and ſelf-bethinking, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal, <hi>Luke 15.17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Natures Rational, the firſt mover is the mind by conſideration: In grace, the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is the mind by holy Meditation. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian that would ſet all the wheels of the ſoul on going and improve, that would do great things, and have great attainments, great things effected on the heart, and in the life, much light and wiſdom, much warmth and fervour, high reſolution and courage, large proficiency in godlineſs, muſt be much in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>The greateſt Scholars of the world have not been only great Readers, but Students much in muſing and pondering. The moſt eminent Saints in all Ages have bin this way excellent, as <hi>Job, David, Solomon,</hi> and others, in the Scriptures; as <hi>Cyprian, Ambroſe, Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> and other Saints in ſucceeding Ages.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon theſe, and ſundry other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, this enſuing Treatiſe was taken in hand.</p>
            <p>My purpoſe at firſt was only a private piece, for the ſervice of an honourable perſonage, very exemplary in this pious practice. This occaſioned alſo my taking the greater liberty in the manner of expreſſions. My intendment once accompliſht, I entertained no thoughts of
<pb facs="tcp:47560:5"/>a Publication, till ſome intimate Friends, having the ſight of the Copy, importuned me to let it come ſorth for the general uſe; upon which, a Review of the whole being made, with divers Alterations and Additions, to reduce it more to the help of all, I reſolved to let it come abroad, though imperfect enough. In the firſt framing, becauſe I could not make uſe of my Study uſual helps, Sentences, and Quotations (the ordinary trimmings) were wanting. And being not willing to farther trouble my ſelf, make the Treatiſe ſwell, and the price riſe, I thought it beſt to let it paſs as it is now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to thy view.</p>
            <p>The preſent Age is full of Books; there be Books too many, and yet too few. Knowledge and wiſdom will never in this world arrive at a <hi>Nil ultra;</hi> yet we muſt ever tend to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and preſs hard to the mark. And when ſo many ſtill write after ſo many excellent Treatiſes on the ſame ſubject; this enſuing may the better paſs in the crowd. Though there be the greater lights of Heaven, the Sun, and Moon, and Stars of the firſt magnitude, yet the leaſt appearing Star is ſome luſtre to the Heaven, and light to the Farth. Though ſome pieces of gold Coyn are current, being fair and down weight; yet thoſe more worn and light, may paſs in greater payments.</p>
            <p>Shall this enſuing Treatiſe Iſſue in perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb facs="tcp:47560:6"/>or provoking thee to the due practice of holy Meditation, to make thee a true and real Meditater, or a better and a higher Meditater, to teach thee to take a turn often in the Garden of God, and take the freſh Air of Paradiſe, to be mentally in ſerious muſings, often mounting up to Heaven, and return more enlarged and inflamed, more wiſe and warm at the heart: Let me only requeſt this of thee, to improve ſome of that acquired warmth in thy way of fervent praying, for him that is ever thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in the things of Jeſus,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> From theſe and the like paſſages ſcattered over the Bible, the Obſervation or Concluſion is this: Pious Meditation is the Duty of every Chriſtian; or, <hi>It is the high Inſtitution of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and greatly Incumbent duty of Chriſtians, to exerciſe themſelves much in holy Meditation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A rare and <hi>ſoul-enriching way,</hi> ſuch as none know the ſweetneſs and bleſſed <hi>Incomes</hi> of it, but ſuch who exerciſe themſelves in it.</p>
            <p>Philoſophers tell us, there would be no life or motion in the lower World, if the Sun and Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Bodies ſtood ſtill.</p>
            <p>Phyſicians ſay, if the <hi>Heart</hi> did not continually beat in the Body, there would be no life and motion in the little World, <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Experience proves, if there were no Springs or Weights in Watches and artificial Engines, they could perform nothing.</p>
            <p>What the Sun, Moon, and Stars are to life and motion here below, what the Heart is to the Bodies life and moving, and what the Springs and Weights are to Motions Artificial, that in a high degree is Meditation to ſpiritual Life and Motion.</p>
            <p>Of the various things tendred to us for truths, this is the great Trier, the Percolation and Refiner, the Melioration and Improver. Such things that come to us crude and raw, become <hi>mellow</hi> and <hi>concocted</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:47560:10"/>by Meditation. It is the <hi>Golden Scale</hi> to give Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things their due weight. The Souls <hi>Rare Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi> to effect the higheſt Operations, to extract the richeſt Spirits for Heart uſe.</p>
            <p>Meditation is of that happy Influence, it makes the <hi>Mind</hi> wiſe, the <hi>Affections</hi> warm, the <hi>Soul fat</hi> and <hi>flouriſhing,</hi> and the <hi>Converſation</hi> greatly fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.</p>
            <p>Who can but practiſe it, continue it, contend to larger improvements in this Heavenly Art, that hath once experienced and fed upon the ſurpaſſing ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and refreſhments, the unſpeakable ſolaces and raviſhments, both had and heightned in it?</p>
            <p>To ſpeak of it <hi>adequately</hi> I cannot, it is ſuch an attainment that none know <hi>the All of it.</hi> Nothing but progreſs in the daily practice, can help to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it. There is ſtill, a <hi>plus ultra,</hi> a <hi>Going and a Knowing further.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall ſpeak to four things only concerning Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</p>

            <p>There are among others, <hi>four</hi> Inſtances, which I ſhall ſingle out, four famous, holy, and eminent ones.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:47560:11"/>
            <p>The firſt is that of the <hi>godly Patriarch Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 24.63. <hi>Iſaac went out, in the Evening, to meditate.</hi> God is a moſt <hi>free Agent,</hi> as in all other actings, ſo in conferring his <hi>Scripture Honours.</hi> He honours whom he pleaſeth, and when and how he pleaſeth. He is bound to give no account of his matters. And oft we ſee him in his Goings and Doings, but <hi>cannot</hi> by ſearching <hi>find him out. Job.</hi> 11.7. Divine Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty and Wiſdom, is pleaſed in the Scripture Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, to <hi>fix the firſt honour,</hi> of this practice of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, on holy <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doubtleſs, his ſo excellent Father, <hi>holy Abraham,</hi> did uſe to beat this path to Heaven, who walkt ſo <hi>much with God.</hi> Doubtleſs thoſe other Patriarchs and Saints, living before <hi>Abraham, travelled</hi> much in this heavenly Road. <hi>Enoch</hi> for his <hi>walking</hi> with God, ſo highly honoured, was no ſtranger to this way. Queſtionleſs it was one <hi>of his walks.</hi> He <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly</hi> uſed to go <hi>to Heaven Mentally,</hi> before he was tranſlated <hi>Perſonally. He uſed to aſcend up</hi> by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, before his <hi>happy tranſlation.</hi> But <hi>Iſaac</hi> is he who firſt is mentioned, for acting this holy Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating. It may be he <hi>exceeded</hi> and <hi>excelled</hi> in this Heavenly Art and Practice; and becauſe it was a Duty performed privately, and that was not known, God would reward and honour him <hi>openly,</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it known, and that ſome hundreds of Years after, by <hi>Moſes</hi> his <hi>holy Pen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's probable there was ſomething more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in it, which occaſioned this firſt Record of Meditation. However, this was the holy pleaſure of <hi>God</hi> ſo to fix it; to place it firſt on the File of godly Meditators. <hi>Iſaac</hi> is the firſt mentioned <hi>Meditator</hi> in Scripture Records.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47560:11"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Inſtance</hi> 2. The ſecond (which is the <hi>fulleſt</hi> to all intents and reſpects) is that high and noble <hi>Precedent</hi> of holy <hi>David, That man after Gods own heart:</hi> among other reaſons, I believe, for his beating ſo much this path to Heaven: for the frequencies of his viſits made this way.</p>
            <p>He ſoon became a man of <hi>Great Troubles</hi> and <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets:</hi> yet then in them, he would <hi>reſolutely cut out</hi> his way, and keep his courſe of holy Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; witneſs thoſe many Pſalms penned in and on occaſions of his troubles, and ſtiled his Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He after <hi>Sauls</hi> death is crowned King of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> had his great multitudes of high Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, was a mighty Warriour, and ſo muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to higheſt hazards; yet nothing, in no time whatever, ſhould check or retard his courſe. Though he had his <hi>Head</hi> full of Thoughts, his <hi>Heart</hi> full of Troubles, his <hi>Hands</hi> full of Work, nothing ſhould hinder him in this <hi>high Exerciſe</hi> of his ſo experienced ſweet Meditation.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. He makes Meditation the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of a bleſſed man, <hi>To meditate in Gods Law day and night.</hi> And what he makes a Rule for others, he makes good in his own Example.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.97. <hi>O how love I thy Law, it is my Meditation all the day!</hi> there's the practice of the firſt time the <hi>day,</hi> and a full Example, and Practice, <hi>All the day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.148. <hi>Mine Eyes prevent the Night-Watches, to meditate in thy Word;</hi> there's the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the other time mentioned in the Character in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2.</p>
            <p>Not a Watch ſet in the Night, but he had his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation. O moſt admirable frame of ſpirit!
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47560:12"/>A King and a daily Meditator, and a night Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator alſo!</p>
            <p>It was not Family Buſineſs, nor State Affairs, not Wars Urgencies and Difficulties, that ſo could crowd in and impoſe upon his thoughts, but he would have his ſpiritual <hi>retreats,</hi> his ſoul <hi>repaſts,</hi> in Meditation, mount up to Heaven by it. Trace we him with the Eye of dueſt Obſervation over the Book of Pſalms, (the Pſalms which are the choice and rare Records <hi>of his Exemplary this way actings</hi>) we find moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Patterns, of all ſorts, as for this holy Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe: Singular Meditations ſometimes of the great Works of God, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein the Fire kindles and flies up, in the higheſt ſtrains. His heart, like the moſt rare and exquiſite Engine and Inſtrument, produces-ſuch raiſed and ſublimated things, that tranſcend ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times all the ſtrains of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> and <hi>Poetry</hi> in the world, as ſome very learned men obſerve.</p>
            <p>Sometime his Meditations (and there they ply more, as of nearer concernment) are on <hi>the Word of God,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and what paſſages and praiſes hath he, moſt high and ſweet, and ſavoury, that what can be fuller and high, for the nature and properties of it!</p>
            <p>Sometimes the <hi>moſt bleſſed God himſelf</hi> is the high ſubject of his Meditating: and what tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies of thoughts, what Raptures and Raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, what Inſtances of higheſt Soul tranſportings hath he this way recorded for us, purpoſely to put us upon purſuit of the like Glimpſes and Taſtes, by ſuitable firſt breathings and pantings after ſweeteſt communion with him!</p>
            <p>It is evident, he was a <hi>grand Maſter</hi> in this Art of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47560:12"/>Meditation, by the ſo <hi>exquiſite pieces</hi> drawn to the life, and reſerved for uſe and imitation in the Book of Pſalms.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third Pattern is that of the <hi>ſo wiſe Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> who gave his <hi>heart,</hi> as he ſaith, to <hi>ſeek</hi> and <hi>ſearch,</hi> and to <hi>know wiſdom, Eccl.</hi> 1.13. and <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>ch.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Davids</hi> ſtrain of Meditation, <hi>proceeds principally</hi> on matters in themſelves <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> as God, his Word, and Ways, and ſometimes on the Works of God. <hi>Solomons</hi> more upon <hi>things na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> and the ways and works of men, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1.13, 14. but to demonſtrate the <hi>inſufficiency of all things</hi> in the world, and all the works of men, to make up true happineſs, without the true fear of God, and keeping his Commandments, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.13.</p>
            <p>This is the ſum and ſcope chiefly of that his Book, that Book of moſt deep and great Conſiderations, and excellently uſeful Meditations, for all to obtain wiſdom by.</p>
            <p>It is (of all) the <hi>choiceſt piece</hi> of Scripture, in this kind; it ſets us an accurate Copy, of regular and fruitful Contemplation and Meditation, of all things under the Sun, which we ſhould ſtrive to imitate and write after. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.14.

            <p>To teach every perſon, by this his ſo eminent and exemplary acting, his ſucceſsful ſearching, to do in the like manner. To <hi>infuſe his ſpirit,</hi> and lay it aſteep ſtrongly and deeply in this Meditation, of Creature vanity, and the vanity of all mens labours under the Sun.</p>
            <p>Yea to <hi>ſink this</hi> down to the bottom of the ſoul,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47560:13"/>there to fix and root it ſelf; thence as by a moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and predominant principle, to work and act up to more <hi>weanedneſs</hi> from things of the world; and to more <hi>warineſs,</hi> of our being enſnared by them.</p>
            <p>The fourth <hi>rare Inſtance</hi> is of the female Sex, That of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin Mary.</hi> Luke 2.19. <hi>But Mary kept all theſe ſayings, and pondered them in her heart.</hi> This is the <hi>remarkable</hi> and ſpecial Example of Meditation mentioned (that I know of) in the New Teſtament: We have none ſo punctual and plain, which I can remember, as this.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>ſignal</hi> honour is hereby intended to this ſo Bleſſed Virgin, to be ſo noted, more than others, in the Goſpel Records: and thereby held forth, as a pattern, and provocation to all after Ages.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scriptures ſilence,</hi> as to other Saints practice in this Duty, is not a <hi>Negative</hi> or an <hi>Excluſive of their doing it:</hi> Becauſe it is not ſaid of every one, they Pondered, or Meditated, we muſt not thence infer they did it not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> in the firſt Pſalm and ſecond Verſe, ſaith, the <hi>Bleſſed man meditates in the Law of God, day and night.</hi> He therefore makes it a neceſſary Duty, and certain Character of every godly perſon, <hi>in ſome ſincere meaſure,</hi> and <hi>conſtancy performing of it.</hi>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Nature and Deſcription of this ſolemn Meditation.</head>
               <p>MEditation according to the uſual Notion and Acceptation, is taken for any ſerious or ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt thinking of any matter whatſoever, for what end ſoever, whether it be good or evil. So Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating is uſed in the Scripture, not only in a good ſenſe, but in an evil ſenſe. So <hi>Pſal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ordinarily it is taken in a good ſenſe, for a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mind Exerciſe, or acting the thoughts in any ſeriouſneſs upon any matter in a ſpiritual manner. There is a double kind of Meditation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which is more ſet and ſolemn, when a man is ſerious in thinking of any thing for ſome ſpiritual end, and ſo as to allow ſome due ſpace of time for a right performance of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is that which is called Meditation of Ejaculation, which, though ſerious, yet is more ſhort and quick, and ſudden, wherein the ſoul darts up to Heaven, and makes a ſhort viſit thither.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin with the firſt, that which more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is called Meditation. The other ſhall follow in its due place.</p>
               <p>Therefore having mentioned ſome Scripture In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances or Examples of Meditation as to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it, I ſhall come to handle the Nature and Deſcription of the ſet and more ſolemn Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Here firſt I will endeavour to preſent you with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47560:14"/>the true Picture, and <hi>Deſcription</hi> of Meditation, in ſome Scripture lineaments and proportions: and afterward the Explication and peculiar hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them.</p>
               <p>I ſhall give you the Deſcription in this manner; It is that <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> or <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> whereby he acts his ſpirit into a <hi>right pondering</hi> of either <hi>heavenly</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual things,</hi> or <hi>any other things,</hi> in a <hi>holy</hi> manner, unto <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> ends and improvements only.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here is the more <hi>general</hi> Nature founding it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The more <hi>peculiar</hi> Nature and particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſties finiſhing it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The more general Nature, in a <hi>double Aſpect:</hi> The <hi>firſt looks</hi> up to Chriſt, it is his Ordinance, his Inſtitution. The <hi>ſecond looks</hi> down to man, it is his Obedience, his Duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here is the particular Nature and Requiſites. Where firſt</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Object.</hi> I will conſider the <hi>Proper Object</hi> of this Meditation, in two parts; 1. Things <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and heavenly. 2. Things though not in themſelves ſpiritual: yet in a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> manner lookt upon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The acting on it.</hi> The acting on this Object, by way of <hi>right pondering;</hi> where many particulars will be opened.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Ends of this Meditation, for only ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ends, or the ends to be levell'd at, muſt be ſpiritual and only holy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The more general Nature of Meditation, we ſpeak to: It's 1. Chriſts own Ordinance. 2. And then mans Duty and Obedience. It is Chriſts own Ordinance, as thoſe Scriptures fore-cited, and many
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47560:14"/>other, which will be after-named, prove.</p>
               <p>Three things there are in an Ordinance of Chriſt, which I ſhall ſpeak of.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>Riſe and Original,</hi> it is heavenly.</item>
                  <item>2. The <hi>Nature,</hi> it is ſpiritual and holy. Yea,</item>
                  <item>3. The uſe and end, it is for a help.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Riſe</hi> and <hi>Original,</hi> it is glorious and tranſcendent: it comes as <hi>far</hi> as Heaven; it is Heaven-born and bred. It bears <hi>Chriſts Image</hi> and ſuperſcription, Brings his <hi>Broad-ſeal</hi> and Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it is one <hi>bright beam</hi> of Chriſts Sovereignty, ſhining down upon us, <hi>One holding out</hi> of his Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Scepter, for us to touch the top of it. It comes <hi>with the King of Heavens Muſt,</hi> it muſt be yielded to, done as the ſtrict and high Command of the great King of Saints, given in <hi>Indiſpenſible</hi> Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity: yea with the very ſame <hi>Cogency</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> that Praying, Hearing the Word, or any other moſt uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally yielded to Duty doth.</p>
               <p>Commonly (as by our daily practice we prove it) we <hi>lay not ſuch ſtreſs</hi> upon Divine Meditation, as we do upon other Scripture Inſtitutions. As if there were a <hi>leſs weight of Chriſts Regal Scepter</hi> in it. As if it were <hi>not ſo current Coin</hi> of his, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like <hi>ſome light Gold,</hi> which we need not receive, except we pleaſe. Whereas this Duty of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion comes in Chriſts Name, to every ſoul; and with a <hi>Commiſſion as full and firm,</hi> as any other Goſpel Command or Duty whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An Ordinance of <hi>Chriſt is holy.</hi> Every Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a participation, and carries a ſtamp and beam of God's glorious Holineſs. Not only of his Regal Authority, but of his inconceivable <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Purity:</hi> The Holineſs of God is, that <hi>glorious
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47560:15"/>Attribute</hi> of his, whereby being free from all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, he wills and orders all things for his <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The holineſs of an Ordinance, is chiefly that by which it is <hi>laid</hi> and <hi>levelled</hi> full at the grand ſcope and mark of <hi>God's higheſt praiſe</hi> and <hi>honour.</hi> It muſt be lookt on, and repreſented to us, as an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment for the moſt High God, his Higheſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. All <hi>Religion</hi> is principally <hi>for living to the Living God, Rom.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. All Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are but the higher and <hi>more eminent ways</hi> given us, for exalting him. So <hi>many aſcents</hi> and riſing grounds, whereby he may mount aloft, and become more tranſcendently great and glorious. If this be not the predominant Ingredient in our performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we are quite miſtaken; and ſo <hi>take his bleſſed name in vain.</hi> This therefore being the <hi>chief thing,</hi> this Ordinance of Meditation ſtands charged with, muſt accordingly be minded and meant in it, God's Inſtitution of it. Firſt, for his <hi>own higheſt Intereſt,</hi> his intending it firſt for himſelf, who ſo infinitely ſurpaſſes all Created Beings and their <hi>total Intereſts,</hi> whatſoever they can amount unto. This is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Conſiderable, an Ordinance is Holy, chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for lifting up God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An Ordinance <hi>is helpful,</hi> for our heavenly help; by Grace and the <hi>Lord</hi>'s Condeſcenſion, it is an Appointment and Inſtitution for us. For our chief Intereſt, the High-way of our Souls help: an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment and a Means to the main Mark of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: The <hi>ſingular way</hi> of our God's deviſing: The <hi>ſweet way</hi> of our great Prophets <hi>Teaching:</hi> Chriſt's firſt ſetting me up a Light, and therewith lending me his hand of help; all Goſpel Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47560:15"/>carry <hi>light</hi> and <hi>help</hi> with them: The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures call them ways, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.3. They are <hi>Gods ways,</hi> and they are alſo <hi>our ways.</hi> They are firſt the King of Heaven's High-ways, his Inſtitutions and Appointments for us: And they are our ways, our High-ways to travel up to the City of God, Heaven: our ways to walk in to our chief Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>I muſt look upon Chriſts Ordinances, not as meer <hi>Impoſitions</hi> and <hi>ſignifications</hi> of Chriſts Sovereignty; not as Burdens and Tasks, the <hi>products</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of ſeverity; but ſuch as are the <hi>Demonſtrations</hi> of his Graciouſneſs and Pity: He ſets me, and ſhews me the way, who juſtly might leave me to loſe my way, and to loſe my ſelf; to loſe both my Labour and Life, Heaven and Happineſs, and that for ever.</p>
               <p>Theſe three forementioned Conſiderations, ah what exteam need hath every one, <hi>to give them the keeneſt edge,</hi> to make Meditation <hi>more penetrative</hi> and powerful? To both <hi>facilitate</hi> it to us, and <hi>fortifie</hi> it in our Hearts?</p>
               <p>Ah when we are to Meditate, how do we ſtill find our ſpirits all over-run and tainted with carnal and <hi>helliſh Repugnancies,</hi> and recoilings againſt it? <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21. how <hi>biaſſed and acted</hi> with ſtrong di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions from it? How <hi>ſunk down ſuddenly,</hi> in dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and flatneſs in it? How <hi>overcome.</hi> with faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fits and feebleneſs in it, from the poyſonous Fumes and dangerous Damps, aſcending out of the Hell of Corruption, lying at the bottom of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits? And <hi>how ſtill abuſed</hi> by the frequencies of our hearts Deceitfulneſs and Miſcarriages about it? The more <hi>high, holy,</hi> and conducing any Ordinance of Chriſt is, the more <hi>fearful and ſad</hi> are the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47560:16"/>of the Enmity and Hell in our Hearts, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt it. <hi>Domine Gehenna ſum, Lord I am Hell,</hi> ſaid that devout Meditator.</p>
               <p>Ah what Floods, what Seas of Conſiderations have we need of, to quench theſe Helliſh ſparks that riſe up in our Boſoms? What need of all the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly fire we can make and kindle, to extinguiſh this Helliſh Fire, that ſo quickly burns and flames up? As we ſee the Sun to extinguiſh the Fire on the Hearth: Celeſtial Fire our Culinary Fire.</p>
               <p>This may ſuffice for the firſt thing, Meditation is an Ordinance of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To come to the Second, it is our Incumbent Duty, our Obedience to the great Law-giver Chriſt.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>A Duty in reference to Chriſt.</hi> Neceſſity in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Chriſt himſelf; an Obedience to his Law, a ſubjection to his <hi>Crown Imperial,</hi> an homage and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47560:16"/>ſervice due to him, as the Sovereign Lord of our Souls, and of that Meditating and <hi>pondering faculty</hi> he endowed them with.</p>
               <p>Meditation is Jeſus Chriſts <hi>Reſervation</hi> in the <hi>great Gift</hi> and <hi>Grant</hi> of our <hi>Souls Thinking power.</hi> He hath endowed us with that ſo <hi>Noble Faculty</hi> of minding and muſing, and alſo with a large <hi>Mind-Charter,</hi> and liberty of thoughts, for our own <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> and ſober <hi>Recreatings, in our Contemplations or Studies.</hi> But yet, 'tis always provided, that <hi>a holy Tribute,</hi> out of <hi>the whole of our thoughts,</hi> is ſtill duly to be paid in, and that as <hi>an acknowledgment both of holding our thinking faculty upon him,</hi> (Rom. 11.36.) <hi>and our beſt way of employment of it:</hi> and this to be <hi>done, in the due ſeaſons, both Ordinary and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.</hi> The neglect of this Duty, is a <hi>deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of his Right and Royalty over my thoughts, and over that which is ſo <hi>eminent</hi> an Endowment of the Mind, and given in to the Spirit by God, for <hi>its chiefly Thinking of him that is ſo High</hi> and <hi>Allſufficient,</hi> and the <hi>ſurpaſſing</hi> excellent things of God, as being the Souls beſt acting.

               <p n="2">2. Duty to my ſelf, and <hi>my own Soul Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> is another great Conſideration here.</p>
               <p>In all, doing Duty, there's a doing my ſelf right, paying in to my own Soul its due. Neglecting in any kind my Duty, is a <hi>wronging my own ſoul. Prov.</hi> 8.36. <hi>He that ſins againſt me wrongs his own ſoul:</hi> Performing it is a doing my Soul Right. Yea, holy
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47560:17"/>Duties are the <hi>Higheſt doings of right</hi> to our Souls. There's no way of doing better to my ſelf, than go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the King of Heavens High-way.

               <p n="1">1. As to the Foundation or Preparative to it, This muſt be laid above in Heaven, by the Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or <hi>Preparative</hi> work of fervent Prayer. The foundation of this Soul Affair muſt be, as a <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man</hi> ſaith of the Foundation of the World: The Foundation of the World, he ſaith, is the. Third Heaven, which is of a <hi>conſtant incorruptible Nature, of no pre-exiſtent principles, and ſo not liable, as other things are, to corruption and reſolution: and

Fervent Prayer: The word in the Hebrew uſed for Meditation, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies alſo Prayer, Prayer and Meditation being ſo near a kin, and the one helping mutually the other.</p>

                  <item>4. To act <hi>vigorous and ſtrong recumbencies</hi> on Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, for his both <hi>Teachings</hi> and <hi>Touchings</hi> of our Spirits, and upholdings likewiſe in the work.</item>

               </list>
               <p n="2">2. As to the forming of the Duty in the Parts and Particulars of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It muſt be bottom'd and riſe from the Spring and <hi>Great Principle</hi> of Motion and Action, which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47560:18"/>is <hi>the will;</hi> in a both <hi>free</hi> choice, and firm purpoſe. A reſolvedneſs, and rooted purpoſe: Thus <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 119.48. <hi>I will meditate in thy Statutes,</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 15. <hi>I will meditate in thy Precepts.</hi> The evil heart ſaith, <hi>I will not Meditate:</hi> Satan ſaith (ſo far as he can hinder) <hi>you ſhall not:</hi> And the prophane World ſaith, <hi>you need not.</hi> But the holy heart ſaith, <hi>I will Meditate.</hi> This is my free and firm purpoſe, and nothing by Chriſts aſſiſtance ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert me.</p>
               <p>The Philoſopher ſaith, that in every virtuous action there muſt be a <hi>choice</hi> of Will, it muſt be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, be Elective, come free from the Spring of the Will, and run in Reſolution: otherwiſe it is not a virtuous Action.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures, for all Religious Actings, call for Willingneſs; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the day of thy Power;</hi> or as it is in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, <hi>A people of willingneſſes, thy people:</hi> And in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places, call for Readineſs in what we perform to God. No work in the World can challenge that intenſe degree and ſhare of Readineſs and Freeneſs, as Chriſts work, and ſuch ways as have a clear and lively Stamp of his Royal Will and Command. No higher Character is given in Scripture of a <hi>Real God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> than freeſt Choice of Will and Readineſs. <hi>To Chuſe the good part,</hi> Luke 10.42. <hi>To Chuſe the things that pleaſe God,</hi> Iſa. 56.4. and as in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of places is to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>A Carnal heart acts from <hi>Carnal Wiſdom,</hi> and ſelf-Intereſt, or from Paſſion and <hi>ſelf-biaſſing affection,</hi> but not from <hi>pure freeneſs</hi> and deliberate Choice of Will. That is not the Spring and riſe of his Duties, as it is in a good and holy heart. A
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47560:18"/>good heart acts from purpoſe, a <hi>well</hi> and <hi>deep ſet</hi> purpoſe: <hi>Acts</hi> 11.23. <hi>with purpoſe of heart to cleave to the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.106. <hi>I have ſworn and I will perform, &amp;c.</hi> So the Will, for holy Duties muſt put forth in <hi>Purpoſes, firm</hi> Purpoſes, <hi>varieties</hi> of freſh Purpoſes: Act <hi>all the ſtill needful</hi> and conducing Purpoſes, any Duty in any reſpect calls for. There are many <hi>Rare and Rich</hi> Attendants and Properties, Ingredients and Excellencies, Divine and <hi>Heavenly Beauties,</hi> appertaining to holy Duties, which the Will muſt <hi>intend</hi> and make its <hi>free firm</hi> Choice of, which the purpoſes of the Will <hi>muſt lye level</hi> to and make after, as the proper and proportionate Marks and higher Tendencies.</p>

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. A right Work.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:47560:19"/>
               <p n="1">1. The Wills purpoſe and intendment muſt be to make <hi>the Duty</hi> of Meditation a <hi>Right Work;</hi> to make ſure it be made true and and ſincere: <hi>John</hi> 4.24. Not a <hi>Carcaſe,</hi> a <hi>Painted</hi> piece, without Soul and Subſtance, a Formality without Power. Not a meer work performed, as it were to flatter God, who looks for a Duty, <hi>As they in</hi> Pſal. 78.86. <hi>are ſaid to flatter God with their lips, but their heart was not right with him.</hi> We are ready to flatter him (inſtead of Realities) with our <hi>Modes of Meditation, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions of Thinkings, with our Formalities,</hi> without Realities and Truth, and the work's being ſincere. It muſt not be a <hi>flattering</hi> of God, but a true pleaſing him, from <hi>being true</hi> it ſelf: It muſt not be a work dawbed over with the <hi>untempered Mortar</hi> of our own hearts ſelf-deceitfulneſs, ſetting up a thing <hi>to ſhew like</hi> it, and be ſomething near it only, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereby a <hi>Cheat</hi> upon our ſelves. Nor make it a thing <hi>only to ſtop</hi> the mouth of our Conſciences, keep them from calling on and challenging of us; but to deſign it ſtrongly and firmly, <hi>to purpoſe,</hi> through God, to proffer to and pleaſe him with a ſincere Work: <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Walk before me, and be ſincere:</hi> This muſt be underſtood, certainly, of every Walk and Path we go in: Not a walk in ſome one way, or divers, and not all; but in every walking, ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity muſt be a Property, a Qualification deſign'd, and firmly reſolv'd: and we muſt not be ſatisfied unleſs it be Right Meditating, ſuch as Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and Saints in Scripture practiſed; <hi>yea that they told God himſelf</hi> that they performed, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.23. And doubtleſs <hi>David</hi> durſt not tell the <hi>Heart-ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> God, he Meditated, if he had done it formally and hypocritically, and not been ſincere and upright in it.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:47560:19"/>
               <p>Again, It muſt be a wiſe work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Intendment of the Will, muſt be for making this Duty a <hi>Wiſe Work,</hi> to make it a Work of <hi>Spiritual Wiſdom:</hi> The Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.15. ſays, <hi>Be not fools but wiſe, underſtanding what the will of the Lord is.</hi> And 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14. there's men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>wiſdom to ſalvation:</hi> And <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is called on for our ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Wiſe in reſpect of God.</hi> Certainly, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did things of great Excellency to ſhew himſelf very wiſe; ſo when the moſt High God's Honour is concern'd, and when he will be preſent at our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, and comes as it were purpoſely to them, ſhall we preſent him with any <hi>fooliſh piece;</hi> not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign a wiſe work, and be ſeen acting wiſely?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Wiſe in reference to our ſelves.</hi> Should we not alſo <hi>ſtrongly purpoſe</hi> to make this Duty a <hi>Wiſe Work,</hi> a Work of ſure Wiſdom <hi>for our ſelves,</hi> and lay it ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly level to the grand mark of Eternal Salvation for our ſelves? <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 17.21. ſaith, <hi>The Father of a Fool ſhall have no joy:</hi> ſo the Parent of a fooliſh act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will have no joy: It is the <hi>Godly prudent</hi> act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whoſe Fruit is Peace, and which iſſues in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly joy. O how ſweet and comfortable is that Duty, in which we have acted up to the Rule of <hi>ſound Wiſdom!</hi> This is the Second Particular, a Duty muſt be Purpoſed and Intended to be a Wiſe Work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>A ſpirited and lively work.</hi> There muſt be a <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>ſtrong</hi> Purpoſe and Intendment for a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſpirited, a <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>warm</hi> Work. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord.</hi> In every Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we muſt have a Purpoſe of <hi>ſtriking fire,</hi> of making the heart burning hot: It muſt not be <hi>luke-warm,</hi> in an indifferency, that's but lazy; nor <hi>Blood-warm,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:47560:20"/>that's <hi>but low.</hi> But the Souls Purpoſe and Deſign muſt be for <hi>higheſt heat</hi> and fervency, greateſt vigour and activity. As <hi>Artiſts</hi> in ſome <hi>High Operations,</hi> endeavours the hotteſt Fire.</p>
               <p>As warmeſt Preaching and warmeſt Hearing, as the Diſciples <hi>hearts burned within them,</hi> when Chriſt opened the Scriptures, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.32. And ſo warmeſt Reading, and warmeſt <hi>Meditating. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's heart, while he muſed, the fire burned, Pſal.</hi> 39.3. So when we Meditate, we ſhould intend a warm work, to be very warm at the heart.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>A ſtriving againſt all lets.</hi> In a ſtrong purpoſe of earneſt ſtriving <hi>againſt all lets and interruptions.</hi> The whole work of a Chriſtian here, muſt not only be vigorous and <hi>ſedulous,</hi> but ſtriving and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate.</hi> Every ſingle and particular Duty muſt <hi>bear a part of ſtriving</hi> to enter in at the ſtrait Gate: For this is to be applied to every particular Duty, though Chriſt ſpeaks <hi>only</hi> in General, bidding us ſtrive.</p>
               <p>Two things <hi>make up the Notion</hi> of ſtriving.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt <hi>Intenſion</hi> and Earneſtneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly <hi>Contention</hi> againſt Oppoſition. When a man ſtrives, he acts earneſtly: and when <hi>he ſtrives after</hi> or for a thing, he ſtrives alſo with that which is againſt him. Striving is againſt ſomething, that letts or oppoſes: In all Soul-work, and peculiarly in this of Meditation, the <hi>throng of Difficulties</hi> is great, the <hi>Oppoſitions</hi> are many, therefore the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and <hi>Reſolutions</hi> of heart muſt be <hi>ſtrong and high.</hi> None ever carry on their work well, <hi>Who are not firſt well reſolved, and ſtill renew and link one firm purpoſe to another, to hold on their courſe to the laſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:47560:20"/>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>A purpoſe for the kindly iſſuing of Meditation.</hi> The Will muſt <hi>purpoſe firmly,</hi> to endeavour ſtill the <hi>kindly iſſue</hi> and <hi>ſucceſs of the Duty. Look,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>John</hi> 2.8. <hi>ye loſe not the things wrought:</hi> who would ſet up at the <hi>Labour in Vain?</hi> Chriſt's ſweet Promiſe is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.23. <hi>The ſeed of the bleſſed of the Lord ſhall not labour in vain.</hi> The way among others, of having it performed, is by grounding our endeavours in ſtrong and <hi>rooted Reſolutions,</hi> for that running and preſſing on, and looking after our Duties doing; until the work winds up, and iſſues in the ſpiritual ends, in the ſweet ſucceſs it is appointed unto: ſuch as encreaſe of Holineſs and Grace, and improvement of Communion with God. <hi>Finis Coronat Opus: Succeſs ſets the Crown on the head of the Work:</hi> Reſolve to get the Crown ſtill ſet on the Head of every Duty, that it <hi>ſhines</hi> in the glory of ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the five ſpecial Branches, this Root of Reſolution ſhould put forth; theſe, as ſo many <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious corner-Stones,</hi> ſhould lye <hi>at the Bottom</hi> of this Building, the better to bear it up.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſhould be, as <hi>ſo many great Arteries</hi> branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth from the <hi>Heart,</hi> to convey <hi>vital ſpirits</hi> into the body of this heavenly Duty of Meditation, and keep it alive, and warm and <hi>improvingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the proper Objects of Divine Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</head>
               <p>FRom things of a remoter relation to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in hand, I <hi>paſs to ſuch</hi> as are the nearer, the more intrinſical and peculiar. And here comes firſt to be handled, the <hi>Matter,</hi> or the Object of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation. When the wiſe King <hi>Solomon</hi> was to build the Temple, firſt he is providing the rich and precious Materials, then he proceeds to the framing and fitting of them, and then to erecting and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that glorious Structure. That which next is to be done, is firſt to look out the Materials of our work, and then the framing and finiſhing up, is to follow: The Materials, or objective parts, are far more rich and precious than thoſe of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple. They are, as our Deſcription of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion holds them forth, either</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Such as are more <hi>properly</hi> and purely ſpiritual and heavenly in their own Nature.</item>
                  <item>2. Or things conſidered, in a <hi>Spiritual way,</hi> and to a Spiritual end and uſe.</item>
               </list>
               <p>It is <hi>not the Conſideration</hi> of things as to their <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi> or <hi>Being,</hi> that is <hi>Metaphyſical: Metaphyſicks</hi> treat of <hi>Entities,</hi> of the meer Beings of things. Of the firſt Being, namely God; and of ſecondary Beings derived from God the firſt Being. It is not the <hi>Conſideration</hi> of things as <hi>Rational;</hi> the Rational reſpects things have one to another, this is <hi>Logical: Logick,</hi> that conſiders reſpects of things, as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47560:21"/>
                  <hi>Cauſes, Effects, Subjects, Adjuncts, and the like.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not the Conſideration of things in their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Natures,</hi> and <hi>Natural properties:</hi> This, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſophy</hi> Contemplates.</p>
               <p>It is not the Conſideration of things <hi>Civil, Moral,</hi> or <hi>Political:</hi> theſe, <hi>Moraliſts</hi> and <hi>States-men</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed about.</p>
               <p>Neither is it the conſideration of particular <hi>Crafts</hi> and <hi>Trades:</hi> this is <hi>Mechanical,</hi> and but a work prudential, and <hi>Humane,</hi> not Divine. But this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation hath Objects of a far higher Sphere and Rank; things of a Divine and Theological Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
               <p>Nay, nor yet is it the <hi>meer Study</hi> of things Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical and Divine. A man may be a Student <hi>in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, beat and buſie his Brains, about the high points and Myſteries in it,</hi> may read and muſe on Matters Divine, and <hi>yet not be a Meditator,</hi> ſuch as we ſpeak of, not <hi>act Divine Meditation.</hi> A man may <hi>act upon things</hi> as Notions, and as <hi>matters</hi> of Knowledge; or to make up an Univerſal knowing perſon, he may <hi>act Contemplation</hi> for <hi>Curioſity:</hi> for ſuch an uſe, as the <hi>Heathen man</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>made</hi> of reading <hi>Moſes</hi> his firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> whereof he paſſed his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and heatheniſh cenſure, that <hi>Moſes</hi> affirms all, but proves nothing, he read firſt, and then ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and then cenſured. But he acted <hi>not Meditation,</hi> not that we ſpeak of: It was <hi>not a conſideration</hi> of ſpiritual things as ſpiritual, and for ſpiritual ends; but only as wiſe man <hi>acts his thoughts,</hi> upon things as <hi>New,</hi> for <hi>New notions,</hi> and improving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Many thus conſider things Scriptural and Divine, ſtudy them, as we call it, ſtudy Books of Divinity, ſtudy <hi>things</hi> in the Scripture; but they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47560:22"/>act not <hi>the Duty of Meditation.</hi> They act upon things as <hi>Matters Intellectual</hi> and Rational, not as Heavenly and Spiritual. Act for <hi>Notion</hi> and <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,</hi> and not for Holineſs. <hi>Act Curioſity, not Chriſtianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The right Meditater far tranſcends any meer Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he acts a <hi>more</hi> Noble part, hath a <hi>more Noble</hi> and ſublime manner of Operation. <hi>Ariſtotles ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Moſes <hi>Writings,</hi> and <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Meditating in the Law of God,</hi> how far do they differ? So a <hi>Heathen</hi>'s or a <hi>Mahometan</hi>'s, or a <hi>Jew</hi>'s, or any ſuch perſons ſtudying matters in the Bible, differs greatly from Meditating in it.</p>
               <p>Nay, <hi>many Proteſtants</hi> are great Students in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>that never Meditated:</hi> they dwell upon the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of it, but touch not with the <hi>leaſt</hi> of their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers the hard work of holy Meditation.</p>
               <p>But to return to our matter in hand, and to ſpeak to this ſubject of Meditation: Formerly it was ſaid, that Spiritual things, or things in a Spiritual and <hi>Heavenly manner</hi> conſidered, are the proper and adequate Object of this Meditation.</p>
               <p>And <hi>bere, O how large</hi> and fair a proſpect hath the Spiritual Eye to Expatiate and Recreate it ſelf in! The <hi>Infinitely Glorious</hi> and All-ſufficient God, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, as the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals: The <hi>vaſt world,</hi> the frame of Heaven above, and Earth below, with all the ſo innumerable things contained in them.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>ſundry Natures, Properties and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes,</hi> with the ſo beauteous and various Excellencies of them. The <hi>mighty Suſtentations</hi> and Preſervations of all things Created, as to their <hi>Beings,</hi> their <hi>Faculties,</hi> and their <hi>Acts.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:47560:22"/>
               <p>The moſt wiſe, <hi>righteous, and holy</hi> Governing of them, with a moſt ſteady and never erring hand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their particular ends; and with a moſt certain winding them all up ultimately, in the <hi>Supream ſcope</hi> of the great Creator and Governour.</p>
               <p>Then that peculiar Government of the rational <hi>Creatures, Angels,</hi> and <hi>Men:</hi> The unſpeakably <hi>ſad full</hi> of ſome Angels, and <hi>all Mankind.</hi> The <hi>Recovery</hi> of ſome men, and their Eternal Salvation, by Chriſt the Redeemer, God in our Nature: Here, here is matter of Meditation, <hi>The great myſtery of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. And particularly, the <hi>four laſt things,</hi> as they are called, <hi>namely Death, Judgment, Heaven, and Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, there is for Meditation, the whole <hi>Book of boly Scriptures,</hi> now compleat in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament-times: with the Ordinances of Chriſt, and <hi>the Covenant of Grace.</hi> And laſtly, the Meditation of that ſo great concern, <hi>our own particular Eſtates,</hi> how matters ſtand with us, and are like to be with us to all <hi>Eternity; which Eternity</hi> challenges and impoſes on every perſon, the greateſt both intenſions and frequencies of thoughts. But though this be ſo great; <hi>yet again</hi> what is there in all the vaſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the whole world? I ſay, what is there, <hi>although never ſo ſmall,</hi> but by a wiſe and holy heart may be an Object improvable to an excellent uſe and end? As the Art of <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> can extract rare and <hi>efficacious</hi> Remedies, out of Dungs, Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions, and Poyſons.</p>
               <p>That Soul muſt be a <hi>pitiful, vain,</hi> and barren piece, that <hi>wants matter and mind</hi> to move and act fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, in ſo large a ſphere and compaſs as Meditation hath: It affords the <hi>whole latitude</hi> of all things
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47560:23"/>properly ſpiritual: And it <hi>compriſes</hi> likewiſe all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, which, in ſome reſpect or other, wiſdom can improve by this rare Art.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No Artiſt in any way</hi> of Operation, with all his rare Inſtruments, and efficacious Engines, can ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate more <hi>eminently</hi> than an Artiſt in this holy kind may do.</p>
               <p>Of this the Scriptures give <hi>plentiful proof</hi> in the many Precedents left us in it for imitation. So we ſee it in <hi>holy David,</hi> in many of his Pſalms (beſides them of the Word of God, his greateſt Subject of Meditation, in thoſe <hi>made of God's great works</hi>) yea the <hi>works of his common</hi> Providence and Guidance; as the <hi>growing</hi> of the Graſs, and Herbs, and Trees; the <hi>ſinging</hi> of the Birds among their Branches, in <hi>the waters,</hi> the playing of the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> the <hi>innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable</hi> creeping things in the Seas, and <hi>the going</hi> of the Ships in them, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. The wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> hath his Meditation of the <hi>Horſe-leach,</hi> with her daughters, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.15. The <hi>Ant in her Induſtry, Prov.</hi> 26.14. ſending the Sluggard (that turns on his Bed, as the Door on the Hinges, that often moves, but never removes,) to her to learn Induſtry, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.6.</p>
               <p>Yea ſometimes, the <hi>moſt inconfidenable</hi> things the Scripture takes notice of, for us to mind the <hi>Hairs on the head,</hi> which all are numbred; the <hi>Sands</hi> of the Sea, which though ſo weak and ſmall, is thereby bridled. The <hi>Duſt of the</hi> Earth, by Gods power, as in a Meaſure comprehended, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.12. And not only God's great works and high actings, but the <hi>loweſt actions of men,</hi> and the meaneſt actings of the inferiour Creatures, are in Scripture held forth, as occaſions for this Meditation, as advantage grounds
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47560:23"/>for the aſcending of thoughts, and raiſing up the Mind Heaven-ward.</p>
               <p>All this pains taken by the Spirit of God, in the Scriptures, is <hi>to ſhew what a wiſe and fruitful ſpirit may extract,</hi> by this holy Art of Meditation; yea, to teach us how <hi>conſtantly thought-buſie</hi> we ſhould keep our hearts (like that wonder in Nature, the ſo wiſe and laborious Bee) ſtill in gathering ſome Celeſtial ſweetneſs from every Flower of Scripture or Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or any other Object we ſtay upon.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Requiſites for Meditation.</head>
               <p>FRom the Object and Matter of Meditation, we muſt next come upon the Requiſites and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, and the things contained in it, and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting of it.</p>
               <p>Here by the way, there were <hi>two ſorts</hi> of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mentioned.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That <hi>which is ſet</hi> and more ſolemn.</item>
                  <item>2. That <hi>which is ſhort, ſudden,</hi> and ejaculatory.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt that, which <hi>more properly</hi> is called Meditation, is that ſo frequently we have ſpoken of in the Scripture, and mentioned in our Divinity-Books, and in Diſcourſes. Meditation in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary acceptation of the word, taken for a <hi>work of time, ſeriouſneſs</hi> and ſolemneſs, that muſt have <hi>a due proportion</hi> of Time, Labour, and Diligence, <hi>to effect that upon</hi> the heart, it is to be uſed for.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is that <hi>which is called Ejaculation,</hi> ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47560:24"/>quick acting, or aſcending of the Soul to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. This is a <hi>holy ſpark</hi> flies up out of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fire, burning ſuddenly in the heart, this is but Meditation rather more improperly ſo call'd. Of this I ſhall ſpeak ſomething hereafter.</p>
               <p>But that we are now to proceed upon, is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation <hi>more properly</hi> ſo call'd, more ſet, ſolemn Meditation, a buſineſs of time and ſeriouſneſs.</p>
               <p>There are divers things, I ſhall mention eight Particulars, or Requiſites for this Meditation. There are eight Requiſites I ſhall mention.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There's requiſite a <hi>Holy Awe</hi> and Reverence, a putting on a reverential frame of heart ſutable to the holineſs of the Duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is requiſite a <hi>Retreat of the Thoughts,</hi> calling off the mind from all its preceding excurſions or engagings otherways.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There's requiſite, the ſetting <hi>of a ſtrong Guard,</hi> and ſo ſure a Watch upon our ſlippery ſpirits as we are able, to ſecure it againſt all diverſions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Meditation, as to the Form and Nature, proper Notion and Eſſence, conſiſts <hi>in Application</hi> of the Mind and Thoughts, and ſetting them upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or Matter intended to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Meditation, as to the Nature and Eſſence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, as in Application of the Mind to, ſo <hi>in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion</hi> and <hi>due ſeriouſneſs</hi> of thinkings on a fit Object.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In a <hi>diving and ſearohing</hi> of thoughts, ſcanning for a beſt diſcovery.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In a <hi>Commoration</hi> and due ſtay of the thoughts upon the work in hand, without precipitation and undue haſtening.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:47560:24"/>
               <p n="8">8. It's requiſite there be an infuſing and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixing the <hi>life and beauties of ſuch affections</hi> as are ſutable and proper for the Duty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Meditation it muſt have the Diſpoſitive and Preparation of <hi>Holy Awe and Reverence;</hi> a ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging the Spirit to, and impoſing upon it, and framing of it, unto all that holy Awe, and higheſt Reverence, which this ſo excellent Duty calls for, both in the Entrance, and over all the Performance. I ſay Higheſt Reverence, as that which is to be done in the ſo <hi>infinitely pure</hi> preſence of a God; a God whoſe eye is obſerving in a ſpecial manner our heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, not only in a Duty performed in his view, but a temper preſented and tendered to himſelf, <hi>as an Homage</hi> and Honour. As a way of <hi>Ingratiating</hi> our ſelves with him, as a way, and one of our ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ways of higher Intimacy and Communion with him.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of a Creature perfect, much leſs of a ſinner, it <hi>cannot have too ſtrong an Infuſion, too deep a Tincture of holy</hi> Reverence.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt Requiſite, a deep Tincture of holy Reverence contended to.</p>
            </div>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the ſecond Requiſite.</head>
               <p>THE next Requiſite is <hi>in ſounding a Retreat of the Thoughts,</hi> and calling off the Mind from all preingagements, not only Evils and Vanities, but all Buſineſs and Duties. Nothing muſt detain the thoughts, or divert the thoughts, when we deſign and <hi>intend</hi> Meditation. God complains of men when Bodies are brought, and Hearts are left out: well may he complain, <hi>if we go about Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a Mind, a Thought Exerciſe, if we let the mind and thoughts be ſent abroad, and not called home.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Philoſophers ſay truly, <hi>that intention can be only of one thing at one particular individual time.</hi> Divinity tells us, there muſt be no allowance <hi>of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intention,</hi> neither a giving way to a ſeiſure of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies to keep poſſeſſion of the Mind; that will keep off that which is incumbent, and our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.113, ſays, <hi>he hated vain thoughts, when they were Intruders,</hi> when they crowded in: much more as they were <hi>Excluders,</hi> and crowded out good thoughts. Therefore <hi>moſt of all,</hi> when they obſtructed and interpoſed at the time of his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Therefore being ſo rare an Artiſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Meditation, he ſtill would ſhake out and empty the Veſſel of his heart of other previous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper thoughts. Do, as <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when <hi>Tobijah</hi> had laid up his ſtuff in the Temple, <hi>he throws it all out</hi> to make way for the proper Furniture.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:47560:25"/>
               <p>Muſing in this ſort therefore muſt have its Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, its ſtand, and its retreat off and from all imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent thoughts: a making the Coaſt clear, a ſetting the mind free, disburdening and diſclogging it: Caſting off all weights when we are to run this Race, and mount up the <hi>Hill of Divine Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Now is the time, to <hi>call to by-thoughts to void the Room,</hi> and leave it free for other thoughts to enter.</p>
               <p>This is the Second Requiſite, a ſounding a <hi>Retreat</hi> to the thoughts from all other things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When Meditation is to be performed, there muſt be a <hi>ſtrong Guard ſet,</hi> a ſure Watch kept upon all Avenues and Paſſages, on all the Inlets and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of the heart.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the Prieſt ſet a Guard round about <hi>the young King,</hi> when he was to be Crowned, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 23.7. ſo <hi>when this Duty</hi> is endangered, and ready to be hindred from having the Crown of a <hi>right per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance</hi> ſet upon it. The Scripture Rules impoſe Circumſpection, great Caution in all our Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but more peculiarly in things pertaining to God, and his Worſhip, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Take heed to thy foot, &amp;c.</hi> ſo <hi>Take heed what you hear.</hi> Aud <hi>Take heed how you hear.</hi> So there muſt be heed, and a great take heed how we Meditate. The ſtrongeſt Guard is little enough, yea too defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and weak, for <hi>the holieſt heart,</hi> and the <hi>beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed</hi> in this part of Godlineſs. O how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivably evil is every heart in its <hi>leakings</hi> and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings out, in its rovings and wandrings, in its <hi>ſlipperineſs</hi> and inconſtancies, and likewiſe in its ſinkings and fallings, inſtead of keepings up in its heat and heavenly vivacity, and keepings on in any evenneſs and equality.</p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:47560:26"/>
               <p>No <hi>Sieve is more unapt</hi> to hold water, no <hi>hand more</hi> unable to hold Sand, or Oyl poured into it, no <hi>bone,</hi> which often hath been out of joint, is more apt to diſlocate and ſlip out of place, than is the beſt heart to ſlip off, rove, and range from this Duty, in Diverſions and Admiſſions of Impertinencies. When we are moſt ſerious and intent, ſuddenly our carnal Spirits give us the ſlip, and are gone: <hi>Like the Bird</hi> if the Cage be but open: Or, <hi>the Priſoner</hi> if the Doors be not faſt and watcht. Or, if the heart get not out in Diverſions, it falls flat in Deadneſs and ſudden Coolings: <hi>Like the Iron</hi> in forging, no longer hot, than the Workman keeps blowing: like melted Metal, which cools as it runs and is pouring forth.</p>
               <p>This made <hi>David</hi> in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> ſo often and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to call for <hi>Quicknings,</hi> from the ſenſe of his frequent heart-coolings and ſinkings.</p>
               <p>The Acting of Meditation muſt not be going up <hi>a Hill of Ice,</hi> where footing is both ſlippery and cold, but like the going up the <hi>Burning Mount Etna,</hi> where the footing if not firm, yet is that which the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers (as they ſay) feel warm: Or like <hi>Moſes, Going up the Mount to God,</hi> which was ſteady and earneſt till he came to the top: Still a due <hi>Guard</hi> muſt be kept about our hearts in this <hi>ſo important</hi> ſoul affair. An <hi>Intenſe care</hi> muſt be uſed, and a holy fear againſt <hi>all Diverſions,</hi> all <hi>heart-ſinkings,</hi> and againſt all <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments</hi> alſo; that we lofe not the real benefit and comfort of this work.</p>
               <p>Theſe three now Explained Particulars, are as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites or Attendants of Meditation: The <hi>next four,</hi> are the ſpecial things, wherein the Nature and Notion of it conſiſts.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Meditation in applying the Mind to a proper Object.</head>
               <p n="4">4. MEditation ſtands in an <hi>Application,</hi> and bringing the <hi>thinking power</hi> of the Soul upon the Object, or Thing to be Meditated of. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that <hi>Great Engine</hi> of the Spirit, and ſetting it to act upon ſome <hi>fit ſubject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The thinking faculty, is a <hi>rare Endowment;</hi> an Engine whereby the reaſonable Creature can draw up and take in any Object, and act or exerciſe it ſelf about it, for that uſe or end we aim at in our think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>In <hi>all Meditation,</hi> there muſt be an Applying and Conjunction of the mind and the thing. As <hi>Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſeeing,</hi> muſt have ſome union, <hi>virtual union,</hi> with the thing ſeen: ſo <hi>Intellectual ſeeing,</hi> ſeeing by the <hi>Eye</hi> of the underſtanding, muſt be, by a bringing the thoughts upon that is to be thought upon. The Scripture hath this Expreſſion, of <hi>ſetting the heart upon a thing, Hag.</hi> 1.5. So it is in the Hebrew, that which we Tranſlate Conſider your ways, is, <hi>put or ſet your hearts upon, &amp;c.</hi> In Conſideration or Muſing there's not only a taking of the heart and thoughts from <hi>foregoing</hi> minded Objects; but a putting or <hi>ſetting</hi> it on ſome New thing, ſetting that on there where it was not ſet before.</p>
               <p>The ſinful heart of it ſelf will run any way; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Earthly</hi> things, upon <hi>evil things,</hi> or upon <hi>Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> and unſeaſonable things; not come to, <hi>or keep
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47560:27"/>upon</hi> that it ſhould intend and mind: Therefore it muſt be <hi>taken as by ſtrong hand,</hi> and ſet upon ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, ſet on Muſing and Meditation of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things. A carnal heart is like the <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> it cleaves to nothing <hi>but Steel or Iron,</hi> and both of them eaſily unite: but the heart muſt be of another property, and act in a higher way. And a good heart, though it thinks too much <hi>Earth-ward,</hi> runs often wrong; yet it will <hi>ſet it ſelf in its thinkings</hi> right, on right Objects, make it ſelf and them to meet and unite. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.112. <hi>David</hi> tells us, how he did, he <hi>inclined his heart to Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> both to keep them, and to meditate on them. He took and <hi>bent his heart,</hi> as a thing bending too much to other things; ſet his mind on Muſing on it. He found his <hi>Heart and the Law</hi> of God too far aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſo <hi>would continue,</hi> unleſs he brought them together and made them one. If he had not <hi>brought his heart</hi> to the Word, he had never Meditated: The Object <hi>cannot</hi> apply it ſelf to the Mind, but the Mind muſt <hi>bring it ſelf</hi> to the Object. No <hi>Holy Duties</hi> will come to us, we muſt come to them. Many in a <hi>ſecret folly</hi> and <hi>ſluggiſhneſs,</hi> would have things do alone of themſelves, without their ſtirring or act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but they miſtake, 'tis ſomething like to <hi>Mahomet</hi> the <hi>Deceiver,</hi> who once told the People that were met by his means, to ſee him have a Mountain, upon his call, to remove and come unto him: but when the Mountain would not come, he boldly then tells them, if the Mountain will not come to <hi>Mahomet, Mahomet</hi> muſt or will go to the Mountain. What he did attempt in pretence, and act in impudence, but was fain to go at laſt to the Mountain, that would not come to him: I ſay, like to this we are ready to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47560:27"/>do in ſlothfulneſs, we look that <hi>Duties ſhould come to us,</hi> that they <hi>do</hi> themſelves, and <hi>we do</hi> nothing: But that which will not come to us, we muſt go to it: We muſt bring and ſet our hearts to this and all other Duties. There muſt not be a letting the <hi>Mind lie ſtill;</hi> that ſo matter of Meditation may come to us, and make us Meditate: But we muſt bring and ſet our hearts to Objects of Meditation, and make this <hi>Happy meeting,</hi> of <hi>Excellent Objects,</hi> and this <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Muſing power.</hi> This is the <hi>more</hi> to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, in that this work of Holy Meditating <hi>hath ſo many buſie Adverſaries,</hi> but <hi>chiefly</hi> in the conſtant progreſs and carrying of it on.</p>
               <p>Ah 'tis <hi>extreamly againſt</hi> the grain of a natural heart, to be <hi>broken off</hi> from its cuſtomary wildneſs, wandrings, and rangings of thoughts.</p>
               <p>To <hi>cage up it ſelf,</hi> and <hi>become tame and tuned</hi> to ſerious Muſings and Thinkings Heaven-ward. In the beſt heart, <hi>that ſin that ſo eaſily beſets us,</hi> it will be ready <hi>quickly to interpoſe,</hi> and cut off the Paſſages, otherwiſe open.</p>
               <p>O how the heart <hi>ſtrives to beſet and block up all</hi> Paſſages, when we are beginning to enter on this Work! All the <hi>whole Garriſon</hi> of <hi>diſ-inclinations</hi> and <hi>repugnancies,</hi> the Helliſh heart, venoms, and contrarieties take inſtantly the <hi>Alarm,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to hinder the hearts conjunction with ſpiritual Objects by this Meditation. The Soul under its <hi>Complications</hi> of Luſts and Corruptions, is as if you had a <hi>Bowl</hi> of many <hi>Biaſſes</hi> clapt upon it, all ready to draw diverſly, but all from the <hi>Duty</hi> in hand: And as Natural Corruptions will be acting Contrarieties and Diverſions; ſo old <hi>Cuſtomary Evils, haunts</hi> and <hi>wonts</hi> will be <hi>calling upon us,</hi> coming to give us
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47560:28"/>their viſits, calling us off to ſome other way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Satan</hi> alſo, and the Power of darkneſs will not be abſent at this time, that may turn ſo much to his prejudice, but he will be ſure (if he any way can) to <hi>divert thee totally,</hi> and cauſe the whole current of thy thoughts to run out in uſeleſs <hi>Impertinencies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great <hi>Circumſpection</hi> muſt therefore be ſtill uſed in our ſettings upon this Duty: A work <hi>well begun is half done.</hi> This is the Fourth Requiſite, the bringing the Heart and a Spiritual Object to meet, and be brought to the Eye of Conſideration.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Meditation in a ſerious Thinking.</head>
               <p n="5">5. MEditation includes, as an Application, ſo <hi>an intenſion</hi> and <hi>ſeriouſneſs</hi> of thoughts.</p>
               <p>Serious Objects, and ſerious work, <hi>muſt have thought-ſeriouſneſs:</hi> an earneſtneſs, and acting the <hi>vigour</hi> of the thinking power. We can <hi>think ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> but this <hi>we call not</hi> Meditation; but <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>earneſt minding</hi> muſt be ever an ingredient of due performed Meditating.</p>
               <p>In Scripture it is ſometimes expreſt by the term of <hi>Conſidering. Pſal.</hi> 119.95. <hi>I will conſider thy Teſtimonies:</hi> That is, mind them with a ſerious and earneſt thinking. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.5. <hi>I conſidered the years of old;</hi> he acted in not a ſlight Eying, but ſerious Muſing.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> in his <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> often expreſſes it, by the <hi>term Conſidering; Eccl.</hi> 4.1. <hi>I Conſidered all
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47560:28"/>the Oppreſſions under the Sun:</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> the 4. <hi>I Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all Travel.</hi> Conſideration (beſides the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Mind unto a thing) includes alſo ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>an intenſion</hi> of the Mind upon the Object. Sometimes in Scripture it is expreſt by the word <hi>Pondering, Prov.</hi> 4.26. <hi>Ponder the paths of thy feet:</hi> That is, earneſtly mind them. So <hi>Luke</hi> 2.19. <hi>Mary is ſaid to ponder the ſayings of Chriſt in her heart;</hi> ſhe made it a work of great ſeriouſneſs.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>ſlight and eaſie thinking,</hi> an acting of thoughts curſorily, and when a thing is out <hi>ſo ſoon as in;</hi> and the <hi>thought off</hi> ſo <hi>ſoon as on:</hi> and there is a ſerious thinking.</p>
               <p>The Mind of man hath not only an ability to act, but can put forth <hi>an exceeding great ſeriouſneſs.</hi> That as in things Natural they have not only power to act, but can alſo act <hi>intenſly</hi> and vigorouſly.</p>
               <p>Thus in things <hi>Inanimate,</hi> as in Fire, how hot and intenſe may it be? <hi>In brute Creatures,</hi> how earneſtly can they act, when they put forth their ſtrength? As the <hi>Horſe</hi> in running, the <hi>Eagle</hi> in flying. In things <hi>Artificial,</hi> to what intenſe degrees can <hi>divers Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and Engines operate, and diſcharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? O what can this <hi>Engine</hi> of the Mind of man effect? what <hi>heights</hi> of ſeriouſneſs can it arrive at? What <hi>contributions of earneſtneſs</hi> can it pay in, when it is highly concern'd, when it is <hi>edged</hi> by ſome real or ſuppoſed grand intereſt; as ſome <hi>weighty</hi> Affair, urgent Buſineſs, ſome imminent Danger to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped, ſome rare Pleaſure, high Preferment, vaſt ſum of Treaſure, or ſuch like Engagements? Yea what can the Mind, as to <hi>a high ſeriouſneſs,</hi> act ſometimes upon Objects <hi>totally unworthy</hi> of the thoughts? <hi>vain thoughts can be very eager and intenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:47560:29"/>
               <p>If we can be ſo ſerious in matters inferiour, <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Divine and Spiritual</hi> matters muſt needs claim a <hi>far greater</hi> ſhare of ſeriouſneſs. There ſhould be <hi>no earneſtneſs</hi> of thoughts on any ground or intereſt whatſoever, like to this <hi>Meditating Earneſtneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are <hi>ſeveral ſpheres</hi> of ſeriouſneſs of thoughts which we may obſerve men move in, Steps and Aſcents of Seriouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Country-men,</hi> in their lower ways, have their <hi>plodding ſeriouſneſs;</hi> how earneſt do divers of them appear in minding of their Occaſions, which <hi>they</hi> account great?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Citizens,</hi> in their <hi>higher ways,</hi> have their high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more <hi>improved ſeriouſneſs.</hi> O what are the various earneſtneſſes, how ſtrange and amazing to conſider, are the <hi>daily beatings of Brains,</hi> and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Thoughts, on daily occaſions by multitudes of perſons in <hi>avaſt City?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Students and Scholars,</hi> in their ingenious ways, what <hi>intenſe</hi> and earneſt Muſings do many of them <hi>habit themſelves to;</hi> and what improved Height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the ways of ſtudying to they contend unto? <hi>The higheſt ſeriouſneſs makes the beſt Scholar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Stateſmen</hi> and <hi>Souldiers,</hi> what ſeriouſneſs do their <hi>Grand and Important</hi> Affairs for the Publick (that lies at the ſtake to be preſerved and advanced) engage and draw forth? <hi>How great</hi> is the great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians ſeriouſneſs about his Deſigns?</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Debauchery and Vice</hi> hath its ſinful ſeriouſneſs. Senſuality, Uncleanneſs, <hi>contemplative Fornication</hi> hath in all <hi>Places</hi> and Ages <hi>given higheſt</hi> evidence of unparallel'd ſeriouſneſs: what ever hath raiſed and <hi>wound up</hi> the ſeriouſneſs more; as <hi>in amorous Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> and <hi>wanton Romances,</hi> and ſuch like filthy
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47560:29"/>writings appears? All <hi>ſorts of Vices</hi> and Luſts, the <hi>lower</hi> they lie in the ſink of the ſinful heart, the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> they act, in ſaddeſt ſeriouſneſs and ſtudyings for carnal ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>Black Train of Hell</hi> and Devils, have their unſpeakable heights of Seriouſneſs and Muſings for Souls-deſtroyings.</p>
               <p>But whatever Spheres and Heights of ſeriouſneſs there can be, ſpiritual things of Right, muſt chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge of every Chriſtian, a far other and better ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>perfect Rule</hi> of Religion obliges Chriſtians to <hi>out-do</hi> all others in their greateſt ſeriouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Doubtleſs <hi>the Saints</hi> in all Ages have excell'd in this kind. In their Retirements and happy En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements between Chriſt and their Souls.</p>
               <p>Such as <hi>Enoch, who walkt with God,</hi> ſuch as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holy Patriarchs, ſuch as <hi>Job,</hi> and other eminent ones. And peculiarly <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>ſo rare</hi> Artiſt in this way: What may we alſo ſay of the <hi>Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, bleſſed Apoſtles, glorious Confeſſors</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and the <hi>eminent</hi> Saints and excellent Lights of the Church? theſe no doubt have been <hi>highly</hi> ſerious, in their Heavenly Meditations.</p>
               <p>Certainly the <hi>rare Artiſts</hi> of the World, neither <hi>Apelles</hi> in Painting, nor <hi>Phydias</hi> in Carving, nor <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalus</hi> in <hi>Contriving</hi> the Labyrinth at <hi>Creet,</hi> nor <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes</hi> in <hi>deviſing</hi> his Mathematical Inſtruments, nor <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle,</hi> or any of the great <hi>Philoſophers</hi> did arrive at greater ſeriouſneſs in ſtudy, than the Worthies of Chriſt in the paſſages mentioned before, neither than that ſeriouſneſs of ſuch as lived after the Apoſtles; as holy <hi>Ignatius, Cyprian, Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, Ambroſe, Auſtin,</hi> and others of the Ancients,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47560:30"/>rare men in Contemplation: And ſuch as <hi>not only</hi> the Bleſſed Reformers abroad, <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Bucer, Martyr, Calvin, Zanchy,</hi> and others of them were, but <hi>ſuch of our own Martyrs,</hi> holy <hi>Cranmer, Latimer, Bradford,</hi> and the reſt of that glorious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and as many after them, in the ſeveral parts of theſe Nations; <hi>one</hi> of which would ſay, <hi>he thanked God, that for twenty years together he had ſtudied no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Bible and his own heart.</hi> I believe none of thoſe <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Artiſts</hi> ever acted any <hi>ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> to that height and ſweetneſs, that the holy ones of Chriſt have done.</p>
               <p>But it is time to come now to the next thing.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Meditation in a ſearching and ſcanning.</head>
               <p n="6">6. THis Meditation, beſides Application of the Mind to the Object, and intenſion or ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs on it, includes <hi>a ſearching and ſcanning,</hi> or diving deep, an <hi>extenſion</hi> of thoughts, a looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout or endeavour <hi>of Comprehenſiveneſs,</hi> in reſpect of the Object, ſo far as we can. To make <hi>as perfect</hi> and full a view of it, and to ſee into the <hi>Dimenſions</hi> and Extents of that we think on. Thus when a man ſtudies a thing, <hi>He endeavours an Extenſive</hi> and a <hi>Comprehenſive</hi> ſeeing, and having the fulleſt view. He ſets it not <hi>before</hi> him to ſee a little, but the <hi>moſt</hi> he can.</p>
               <p>The Scripture phraſe I cited of <hi>Proverbs</hi> 4.26. and that of <hi>Luke</hi> 2.29. of <hi>Pondering,</hi> includes this
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47560:30"/>particular likewiſe we now are to treat of. In pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering there is both <hi>firſt</hi> the Minds applying it ſelf to a thing, and the <hi>intending</hi> its acting, and then this <hi>third</hi> of an acting, of ſearching and diving into it, or knowing what we can of it.</p>
               <p>Pondering is an <hi>Expreſſion taken from Goldſmiths,</hi> and Tradeſmen, that deſire to know the full <hi>weight</hi> of a thing, and thereby the value <hi>or worth</hi> for their profit and uſe: Thus the Merchant weighs his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, the Goldſmith weighs his Silver and Gold, the Jeweller weighs his rich Pearls, Rubies, and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, to know them more exactly. There is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>great weight and worth</hi> in Heavenly and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things: Meditation muſt hold <hi>the ſcales,</hi> to weigh, <hi>ſo well as</hi> we can, theſe ſo rich and precious things, theſe Diamonds, and Pearls of Heavenly Treaſure: yea weigh them as things that unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſurmount all other things. As <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom muſt have a ſearching for, as for hid Treaſures:</hi> as the ſearching <hi>for,</hi> and ſearching <hi>in</hi> the Gold and Silver Mines; in which there is <hi>not only</hi> great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs of ſearch, till the <hi>Rich Vein</hi> is diſcovered, but being once found, there is a <hi>following it</hi> with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteſt <hi>Induſtry,</hi> and utmoſt <hi>Curioſity,</hi> to find not a <hi>part</hi> or <hi>quantity</hi> of the Treaſure, but <hi>all</hi> the Riches ſcattered over the whole Mine, part after part. A Chriſtian in his Exerciſe of Meditation, muſt act the part of the <hi>Exquiſite Miner,</hi> to dig deep, dig over all the Mine, and gather up the Riches of it, the leſſer and greater quantities, as they come to view, in the Mines of Spiritual Treaſure. <hi>Travellers</hi> tell us, that in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulf at a certain ſeaſon of the Year, great ſtore of a kind of <hi>Shell-fiſh</hi> is to be found near the ſhore, in which Shell-fiſh they find
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47560:31"/>the <hi>precious Pearls</hi> bred in their Shells: But the way of finding them is by <hi>Diving,</hi> there are men that have an <hi>Art of Diving</hi> down to the bottom of the Sea, and bringing up their Baskets fill'd with theſe Shell-fiſh; the Shells being opened, they find and take out the <hi>Orient and Rich Pearls,</hi> of ſeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, ſome of them very great and rich; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they greatly enrich themſelves and thoſe that deal in them. Meditation is the Spiritual Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants <hi>Art</hi> of Trading for <hi>Heavenly</hi> Riches, Pearls of great price; but there muſt be a <hi>Diving deep.</hi> If we have not this <hi>Art of Diving,</hi> we ſhall loſe the rich Pearls: the <hi>deepeſt diving down</hi> in the practice of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, comes up with the <hi>Greateſt Returns</hi> of Soul Enrichments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> in <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.25. hath <hi>a very emphatical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,</hi> to hold forth this we are upon: Our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation hath it, <hi>I Applied my heart,</hi> but the Hebrew hath it, <hi>I Compaſſed, and my heart that is Compaſſed to ſearch,</hi> and ſeek out Wiſdom: Or, <hi>I and my heart Compaſſed,</hi> ſo in the Margin we have it. There's <hi>Coming</hi> upon a thing, and a <hi>Compaſſing a thing,</hi> the heart in Meditating is to <hi>compaſs in</hi> a thing, as well as it can. They ſay <hi>in Philoſophy,</hi> that wiſdom lies in <hi>Perſpection, Introſpection,</hi> and <hi>Proſpection,</hi> that is, in viewing <hi>throughly,</hi> all over, viewing <hi>inwardly;</hi> and viewing what <hi>may be eventually,</hi> what may be the iſſues of things, it <hi>prys</hi> into a thing, and <hi>looks</hi> round about a thing: makes the Mind endeavour an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive</hi> and <hi>Comprehenſive</hi> knowing, as was ſaid. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation in Spiritual things, ſhould be like <hi>Nehemiah</hi> when he came to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and would go view it; <hi>He went and viewed firſt one part, and then another,</hi> till he had gone round. So Meditation looks
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47560:31"/>largely, views what it can take in and conſider.</p>
               <p>As God took <hi>Moſes</hi> to the top of Mount <hi>Nebo, Deut.</hi> 34.1. ſhewed him <hi>all the Land of Promiſe,</hi> part after part round: Thus when we go up this Mount of Meditation, we muſt ſearch, view, look round, take in as <hi>large</hi> a proſpect as we can.</p>
               <p>This is the Sixth thing Meditating includes as to the Object, a ſpreading our Eye, looking as largely, and ſeeing ſo much as we can, for the Ability and Opportunity is given us.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Meditation is not a haſty hurry of thoughts: that's Precipitation, not Meditation.</hi> It is not gathering <hi>half-ripe</hi> Fruit, that which hath not its time for the <hi>Influence</hi> of Heaven to come down upon it, and its <hi>own internal</hi> principle and power of its Nature, to produce a kindly maturation, a kindly ripening. We will not have (for want of time) our Bread <hi>dough-baked,</hi> or meat <hi>raw-roaſted:</hi> knowing that which is not <hi>rightly</hi> prepared for the body, may breed Diſtempers, <hi>if it bring</hi> not Death. It is not the way to thrive, look well, and be ſtrong, lively and chearful: why ſhould we gather our ſouls pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious fruits <hi>half-ripe?</hi> feed our <hi>Souls</hi> with <hi>dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baked</hi> Bread for want of a little time? Some things muſt have <hi>Infuſion</hi> for taking forth the Spirits and Tinctures of Colours.

But O how <hi>too ordinarily</hi> do the <hi>beſt</hi> of Saints fall ſhort of the actings of <hi>Rare Artiſts,</hi> in their higher Operations, in <hi>their ſtands and abodes
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47560:32"/>of thoughts</hi> for more <hi>curious</hi> Obſervations, and <hi>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual ſatisfactions:</hi> Uſually we are <hi>too haſty</hi> and eager to have Duties over. The Soul is <hi>in pain</hi> till it be delivered of them. In Meditation it is hard (ſometimes at leaſt) to take off the thoughts for it, <hi>from preingagements</hi> of other thinkings, and apply them to the duty. But <hi>harder</hi> to become duly ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in acting in it, <hi>harder</hi> yet to <hi>Dive and Ponder,</hi> and <hi>hardeſt</hi> of all to <hi>hold up</hi> in an abode of thoughts, and dwell long enough, and after <hi>views</hi> to make <hi>reviews,</hi> to <hi>re-act</hi> the ſame thinkings, to <hi>taſte</hi> things over and over, when the <hi>freſhneſs</hi> and <hi>newneſs</hi> is paſt, when by long thinking the things before us ſeem old; we are ready to grow <hi>dead</hi> and flat in a performance, except we <hi>ſtir up</hi> our ſelves often in it. It is hard to <hi>hold on</hi> and <hi>hold up,</hi> unleſs we <hi>hold up a wakeful Eye,</hi> a <hi>warm affection,</hi> a <hi>ſtrong and quick repeated Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution;</hi> yea, and without often lifting up the Soul to Chriſt, for freſh recruits of ſtrength to hold on. <hi>David</hi> that ſo excellent Artiſt in this way, ſaith <hi>he will Meditate, Pſal.</hi> 119. often ſaith <hi>he will.</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he not only ſaid I will, when he was to make his entrance into this hard work; but likewiſe for continuance in it, to keep up his heart from flaging, till he well ended his work. It is not the <hi>Digging</hi> into the Golden Mine, but the <hi>Digging long,</hi> that finds and fetches up the Treaſure. It is not the <hi>Diving into the Sea,</hi> but ſtaying longer, that gets the greater quantities of Pearls. To draw out the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Thread of Meditation to its due length till the ſpiritual ends be attained. This is a rare and happy Artainment: This is the Art, but of the ends of Meditation we ſhall ſpeak hereafter.</p>

               </list>
               <p>They ſay <hi>Beauty</hi> muſt have theſe four things.</p>

                  <item>1. Perfection or Intireneſs of parts, no part wanting.</item>
                  <item>2. Proportions due, no part too great, too little, or unſutable: And proportion of Colour, White and Red in a juſt proportion.</item>
                  <item>3. There muſt be <hi>Right Order</hi> of parts, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be miſplaced.</item>
                  <item>4. There muſt be <hi>ſpirit and vivacity</hi> appearing in the Face, as a chief Ingredient or ſuperaddition to all the reſt, as that which adds ſingular grace and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre to all. So beſides the parts and chief linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there muſt be that which <hi>compleats</hi> the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Meditation: Thoſe things which are as, not only the <hi>Beauteous Colours,</hi> but the <hi>freſhneſs, livelineſs, and ſpirits</hi> aſperſed, and appearing over all the Face of this Rare Piece, this Excellent Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</item>
               </list>
               <p>That as the <hi>Heart,</hi> with its Diffuſions of Heat and Spirits in a due proportion, makes a <hi>comely, graceful, and lovely Colour,</hi> which in Heart-Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Faintings, and Sinkings, diſappear and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh: So the Holy Heart with its Diffuſions of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47560:34"/>heavenly warmth and ſpirits, heavenly affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, makes Meditation comely, beauteous, and lovely.</p>
               <p>If Meditation be only <hi>Head-work,</hi> and not Heart-work, it is like a Picture without life; like a <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> that ſtudies in a meer acting of Wiſdom only.</p>
               <p>The right and <hi>genuine Meditation</hi> is an affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate thing: as the Head acts, the Heart glows. The <hi>life veins</hi> of warm Affections run and diſperſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves through the whole Duty, and <hi>give luſtre</hi> to it. This we may ſee in the Meditations of that great Artiſt in this kind, in holy <hi>David</hi> you may ſee a <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and excellency</hi> of Holy Affection mixt and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven, like the Gold in <hi>the Tiſſue</hi> with the Silk, and <hi>ſparkling</hi> in his this-way-acting. Affections ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing ſet as ſo many Rich Stones, Rare Beauties, and Glories among his various Muſings.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>Three ſorts of Affections</hi> that ſhine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly in <hi>David</hi>'s, and other holy mens Meditations, left upon Record in Scripture, which needs muſt be patterns to provoke us to imitation.</p>

               <p n="2">2. THe next Affection, which ſends a <hi>Great Artery</hi> of vivifical Heat, a <hi>glowing Heat</hi> into this Meditation, is that of Heavenly Love, Love to the Duty and the Excellent things to be Meditated upon: Love is the <hi>great Heart</hi> Fire, made to warm every holy ſervice: <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.97. <hi>O how Love I thy Law, it is my Meditation all the day?</hi> Love led him into this pleaſant <hi>ſoul walk</hi> of ſweet Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and Love kept him company, kept his heart warm in it. <hi>The fulfilling of the Commandment is Love, Rom.</hi> 13.10. and Love is the fulfilling of this Commandment of Meditating: It is performed in Love. This <hi>Heart vital Heat</hi> of Love, muſt move to and in Meditation: <hi>muſt glow</hi> through the whole work all the time of it. Meditation is <hi>either of the infinite</hi> beauties of the moſt bleſſed God, the infinite perfections and ſurpaſſing glories of his Eſſence and Attributes, and of the Three Perſons in that Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: or elſe of the <hi>precious Word</hi> or <hi>Works</hi> of God, his general Providence and Government, or his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Governing of the reaſonable Creatures, <hi>eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially</hi> that ſo ſtupendious work of Redemption by Chriſt, and all thoſe things which are reducible to his praiſe; which muſt needs, being ſo beauteous, have their <hi>ſurpaſſing lovelineſs.</hi> And therefore there is great reaſon to <hi>act love</hi> abundantly towards them: To have Meditation ſtill richly <hi>perfum'd</hi> with actings of burning love all over it.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:47560:35"/>
               <p>O let Love ever come in and act its part in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, wherein the Souls Eye is <hi>not only glancing,</hi> but <hi>wiſhly viewing</hi> the ſurpaſſing beauteous things of Heaven, or ſuch things as may lead up to Heaven. <hi>Ah if I cannot aſcend in a Flame of love, yet let me in Meditation flye up in ſome ſparks of Love. If my heart cannot burn in the flame of Love, let it keep warm upon the Embers of Love.</hi> Let Love give it a <hi>ſpirit, vigour,</hi> and <hi>livelineſs:</hi> As <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple was inwardly <hi>all overlaid with Gold,</hi> let this rare work of Contemplation be overlaid and inlaid with Love: <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.10. as <hi>Solomons Chariot</hi> in the <hi>Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the midſt of it paved with love;</hi> ſo let this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of Contemplation the midſt of it be paved with Love.</p>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47560:36"/>of Aminadab,</hi> that my ſwift running may evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence my Delight in Meditating.

               <p>As Wiſdoms <hi>ways are all paths of pleaſantneſs,</hi> ſo this path it hath its pleaſantneſs and ſweetneſs: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation hath its <hi>rare and moſt pleaſant walks:</hi> No <hi>Habitation</hi> hath ſuch Rooms, ſuch Galleries within, of pleaſure: Nor <hi>Gardens</hi> without with ſuch Walks and Curioſities: No <hi>Situation,</hi> or Stand, ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and varieties of delightful Eye-Objects as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation enjoys.

               <p>There are <hi>ſundry ſorts</hi> of pleaſures: There are <hi>ſenſitive pleaſures</hi> of the external Senſes, as of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Seeing, Taſting, and the like: Theſe are very various and very great, too often too bewitching and beſotting.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>Phanſie, Imagination-pleaſures:</hi> I ſay the pleaſures of Phanſie, which are rare and higher than thoſe of the outward Senſes: Imagination and Phanſie which is a <hi>quick,</hi> ſudden, ſhort, and ſhallow apprehenſion of things (it is not <hi>judgment that ponders</hi>) but <hi>a ſudden ſlight taking in</hi> and acting: this is (eſpecially in ſome ſorts of perſons) a very high Spring and <hi>ſtrong Feeder</hi> of Delight or Pleaſure; of Pleaſures that come like things freſh, quick and ſpirited to the Body and Senſes. Phanſies, <hi>O how they perfume,</hi> like richeſt ſcents, pleaſe like <hi>briskeſt and moſt racy Wine!</hi> Phanſies (though often very fond and vain) yet are great <hi>inſets of Delight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There are <hi>Intellectual Pleaſures,</hi> Rational Joys and Delights: Theſe <hi>are more high,</hi> ſublime, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and therefore more ſweet, ſuch as the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of underſtanding <hi>new, rare Notions, excellent Speculations,</hi> and apprehenſions of ſolid and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Truths, and the Minds Muſings on them, Taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, feeding on them; this in it ſelf is a more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending Delight than the two former; though Phanſies weigh more with ſome, yea, though ſenſual Pleaſures take moſt with abundance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But there are beyond the former, namely,

                  <hi>Solomon</hi> in his <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> that rare Record of his ſo large and infallible Experience of all things for Pleaſure and Delight, tells us he found nothing ſo ſweet, and <hi>which he could act upon</hi> with that Delight, as when he <hi>acted up</hi> in Meditation, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> oft <hi>expreſſes what joy he acted,</hi> in this <hi>ſoul-engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> yea tells us <hi>as he did,</hi> ſo <hi>he will delight</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in it, and the Heavenly Objects of this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly work: <hi>Heavenly things and a heavenly heart meeting in Meditation, will act and make the pureſt pleaſure.</hi>

               <list>
                  <item>1. Meditation ſhould be a work <hi>very ſavoury</hi> on the Palate of the Soul.</item>
                  <item>2. It ſhould be <hi>ſweet and pleaſing</hi> to it.</item>
                  <item>3. It ſhould be with ſatiety in it.</item>
                  <item>4. With an Admiration, as the Crown on the top of it.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. It ſhould be performed, not as a thing that is <hi>diſ-reliſhing,</hi> but ſavoury to the Spirit in the doing: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Thoſe that are after the Spirit, ſavour the things of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are <hi>ſome things are unſavoury</hi> in themſelves, others <hi>though ſavoury,</hi> yet not ſavoury to ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates. The things of Heaven are none of them <hi>in no degree</hi> unſavoury in themſelves: Meditation is not ſo in it ſelf, but to a <hi>carnal Spirit,</hi> it is one of the <hi>greatly unſavoury things,</hi> greatly diſpleaſing and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relliſhing: But to the <hi>Spiritual man</hi> it is not ſo, but a work <hi>ſingularly</hi> ſavoury, like <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s ſavoury meat, like feeding at ſome <hi>noble Feaſt,</hi> where a good ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, and a right Palate, <hi>feed</hi> and ſavour, ſtill ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47560:38"/>the delicacies and varieties ſucceſſively, every thing is ſavoury. There are ſome things ſavoury, as <hi>Nature</hi> yields them; others, <hi>and in great variety,</hi> as <hi>Art reduces and orders them;</hi> and accordingly there are very <hi>admirable diverfities</hi> of ſavoury things, which have their degrees of ſavourineſs: What great varieties are there made by <hi>Art,</hi> from the <hi>meaneſt food,</hi> to the <hi>higheſt delicacies?</hi> yet in the <hi>Goſpel Feaſt</hi> of Fat things full of Marrow and Wine on the Lees well refined, in the Feaſt of all <hi>heavenly varieties;</hi> Meditation hath more <hi>unſpeakably rare dainties,</hi> than all that Nature or Art can yield. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear hath not heard, what God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> Not <hi>the greateſt</hi> of the greateſt Princes, not <hi>Solomons</hi> moſt <hi>Glorious</hi> reaſt, not <hi>Aſſuerus.</hi> his Royal Feaſt, not any of the <hi>Perſian</hi> or <hi>Roman Emperours</hi> ſo much ſpoken of in Hiſtories, could occaſion a Feeding with ſuch <hi>high ſavourineſs,</hi> as may be had in the rich and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things Meditation hath to feed the Soul with. Therefore, O let Meditation be ſtill <hi>moſt ſavoury,</hi> let every ſpiritual thing be very ſavoury; as there are more varieties of Objects, and higher degrees of Excellency in them, endeavour <hi>a ſutable, an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,</hi> and <hi>an enereaſing ſavouring:</hi> As men at a Feaſt paſs from the firſt Diſhes to the after Dainties, with a more eager feeding and better reliſhing. This is the firſt thing.</p>
               <p>As Meditation ſhould be ſavoury, the ſoul well reliſhing of it; ſo likewiſe</p>
               <p n="2">2. It <hi>ſhould be ſweet.</hi> This I further adde, in that the Spirit of God is pleaſed to honour this pious expreſſion of the Holy Prophet (by recording it for us) who after a moſt heavenly <hi>Torrent of Elegancy</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:47560:38"/>in expreſſing the ſurmounting Excellencies of God in the wonderful ways of his workings and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernings, ſays there in the cloſe of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 104.34. <hi>His Meditation of God ſhould be ſweet.</hi> How <hi>ſweet</hi> muſt Meditation be upon <hi>infinite ſweetneſs,</hi> and from whom all other ſweetneſs, Creature-ſweetneſs, Word and Ordinance-ſweetneſs, derives it ſelf?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.103. <hi>O how ſweet is thy Word to my taſte, ſweeter than Honey to my mouth!</hi> This muſt be <hi>chiefly by Meditation:</hi> It is that which preſſes and <hi>ſucks</hi> out the rare ſweetneſs in the Precepts, ſo <hi>Holy and Righteous:</hi> in the <hi>Promiſes, ſo precious:</hi> in the <hi>incour agements,</hi> ſo high: and in all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things in the ſo perfect word of Chriſt. He <hi>not only aſſerts</hi> the ſweetneſs he found in Meditation; <hi>but is tranſported</hi> with high Admiration: And when he <hi>could not ſpeak of it</hi> to the height and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then (which is our uſual manner) when we are at a loſs for expreſſion in words of comprehenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to wrap up our ſelves in the elegancy and terms of an Interrogation and Admiration; yet not <hi>contented</hi> with this way, for fuller repreſenting his experimented ſweetneſs, he takes up a compariſon, ſays <hi>ſweeter than Honey,</hi> which in that pure Air of that bleſſed Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was the moſt <hi>ſurpaſſing ſweet Honey</hi> in the World. Yea, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.10. <hi>Sweeter than Honey, and the diſtilling of the Honey-Comb,</hi> which is the ſweeteſt of all others: But this was <hi>in holy Meditation,</hi> that <hi>made the Honey melt in his mouth,</hi> and give down its ſweetneſs. Meditation <hi>that drives the Hive, drains</hi> the Honey, and <hi>drops</hi> in the delicious ſweetneſs into the Muſing Spirit. Lord <hi>teach us</hi> the way of this Heavenly Art, and make <hi>this Honey</hi> drop, and the Heavenly <hi>Manna</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47560:39"/>Truths fall richly into our hearts. This is the ſecond particular.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Meditation may and ſhould <hi>be attended</hi> with an Heavenly <hi>and ſpiritual ſatiety: Pſal.</hi> 63.5. <hi>My ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied, as with Marrow and Fatneſs, when I remember thee on my Bed, and meditate on thee in the Night-watches.</hi> His <hi>rare hours</hi> introduced and made returns of Heavenly ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>The largeneſs and excellency of it he ſets out by a very ſutable <hi>expreſſion, ſatisfied as with Marrow and Fatneſs,</hi> which to the ſtomack yields the beſt ſatisfaction, the ſpeedieſt and ſweeteſt, the moſt large and laſting. No food ſatiates better than Marrow and Fatneſs. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.6, 7, &amp;c. The Goſpel Feaſt, is a Feaſt <hi>of Fat things full of Marrow.</hi> There are the Fat things of a <hi>perfect righteouſneſs</hi> applyed, of a <hi>full pardon</hi> obtained, of Reconciliation and Peace with God made, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. and glorious Adoption conferred through Chriſt, the <hi>Feaſt of the Feaſt,</hi> together with the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of the bleſſed Image of Chriſt, in the beauteous lineaments of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and righteouſneſs, light and life, of all Graces and Excellencies, and <hi>all drawn to the life, and wrought up</hi> by the Holy Spirits Inhabitation and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and ariſing from Believers happy Union and Communion with Jeſus Chriſt and his fulneſs. And likewiſe as a glorious ſuperaddition, that of <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of a moſt happy condition, and of the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable love</hi> of God, and that bleſſed Hope of Eternal Life, which ſtrews Sugar, drops unſpeakable ſweetneſs and ſatisfaction upon and into the holy heart, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. Theſe and ſundry others are the <hi>fat things full of marrow,</hi> and make up the Feaſt; and are from the actings and <hi>induſtries</hi> of this happy
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47560:39"/>way of Meditation: As therefore the Heart is hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and thirſty, in continual Lingrings and Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and never quiet, Meditation muſt <hi>carry</hi> it to this royal Goſpel Feaſt, and thereby meet with a bleſſed fatisfaction, not being contented with the ſight of the <hi>Feaſt</hi> and the delicacies of it, without attaining ſome happy ſatiety.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> mentions one dreaming of eating, but when he awakes his ſoul is hungry: If we look not well to it, Meditation may be but ſuch an unprofitable thinking, as when we have ended it, we may miſs of this ſatisfaction, find our ſouls empty. It muſt be ſtill ſo managed, that it prove a help and cure to my Soul's <hi>inordinate</hi> lingerings, and <hi>improve</hi> to a ſpiritual ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Morals</hi> tells of one <hi>Pythos,</hi> who finding a rich Mine of Gold, and out of his eager deſire to have the Treaſure in the Mine, was ſo continually attending <hi>at the Mine,</hi> that he neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his comings home to his Meals: To confute his covetous induſtry, his Wife one day (inſtead of providing him food) prepared nothing but Golden Diſhes, with ſeveral ſorts of Meats caſt into the forms of ſundry things edible, but all of Gold; whereby he could obſerve a <hi>curioſity of invention,</hi> but was diſappointed of feeding and ſatiety. We muſt not in our Meditation content our ſelves with feeding the <hi>eye for curioſity,</hi> but endeavour feeding the Soul <hi>unto ſatiety,</hi> heavenly ſatiety. Ah let my Spirit mind more a fullneſs of <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> than <hi>newneſs of Notion;</hi> carry it from Head-work to Heart-work, from bare ſpeculation, to <hi>rare and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing</hi> ſatisfaction!</p>
               <p>This <hi>for</hi> the third particular, Soul ſatiety.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:47560:40"/>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Admiration.</hi> Let me, to ſet the Crown on the head of the Duty, adde one thing over and above, let Meditation be <hi>carried up to admiration;</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould we be affected, but <hi>tranſported,</hi> rapt up, and <hi>raviſht</hi> with the beauties and tranſcendencies of heavenly things, act Meditation to Admiration, endeavour the <hi>higheſt pitch,</hi> coming the neareſt to the <hi>higheſt patterns,</hi> the patterns of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven, whoſe actings are the pureſt higheſt Extaſies and Admirations. Thus were theſe ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Artiſts in Meditation, <hi>David</hi> an <hi>high acter</hi> of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration in Meditation, as often we ſee it in the Pſalms, ſo in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 8.1. and the laſt Verſe, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 31.19. <hi>O how great is thy goodneſs? &amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 104.24. <hi>O Lord how manifold are thy works? &amp;c.</hi> And in other places <hi>Davids</hi> Meditation and Admiration were as his Harp well tuned and excellently played on, in <hi>rareſt airs,</hi> and <hi>higheſt ſtrains;</hi> as the <hi>precious Gold,</hi> and the <hi>curious burniſhing,</hi> or the <hi>richeſt Stone,</hi> and the <hi>exquiſiteſt poliſhing</hi> and ſetting of it. So bleſſed <hi>Paul,</hi> who was a great Artiſt in muſing, <hi>acted high in admiration,</hi> his ſoul was very warm and flaming up in it: It was as a Bird with a ſtrong and long wing that <hi>ſoars</hi> and <hi>towers</hi> up aloft, and gets out of ſight.</p>
               <p>Thus ſundry of the Ancients, as holy <hi>Auſtin, Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> and others of thoſe, who have recorded their <hi>rare hours</hi> of Meditations and Tranſportings of Admiration, liftings <hi>out</hi> of themſelves, and liftings <hi>up</hi> to Heaven. A precious Miniſter of Chriſt oft in his life time would wiſh, he might die in the heavenly Exerciſe of ſinging a Pſalm, in which he uſed to be tranſported in Meditation and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: At length he had, in ſinging a Pſalm, his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47560:40"/>holy wiſh, dying in the performance; whereby he was rapt up (after his raviſhment, in the Duty) into Heaven, changing his <hi>place,</hi> but not his <hi>work.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a man <hi>eminently learned</hi> and heavenly, riding with a friend in his Coach, he fell into a <hi>rare Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation</hi> and Diſcourſe of the glory of Heaven, and the <hi>beatifical viſion;</hi> in which he was ſo <hi>highly raviſht,</hi> that within a ſhort time he was ſuddenly taken from this Earth, to take his poſſeſſion of that Glory he had ſo before in Contemplation.</p>
               <p>Thus I have weakly endeavoured ſome explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this happy work of holy Meditation.</p>
               <p>It muſt firſt be begun with fervent Prayer. It muſt be <hi>founded</hi> in a purpoſe of, 1. A right work. 2. A wiſe work. 3. A warm work. 4. A ſtrong purpoſe of earneſt ſtriving againſt all impediments. 5. An endeavour of the kindly iſſue and ſucceſs.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of the Ends of Meditation.</head>
               <p>MEditation we deſcribed to be an inſtitution of Chriſt, and duty of a Chriſtian, wherein the Mind acts upon ſpiritual things, or <hi>other things in a ſpiritual manner,</hi> by a due conſidering of them, and this to holy ends or ſpiritual uſes only: Now the Ends of Meditation are three.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Three great Ends of our Meditating.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Such as refer to the moſt high God.</item>
                  <item>2. Such as reſpect our ſelves.</item>
                  <item>3. Such as relate to others.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Such as refer to the moſt high God. Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is to be the <hi>motion of the heavenly ſpirit,</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venward; to carry it up to Heaven and <hi>keep</hi> it a time there: A <hi>looking</hi> of the Eye of the mind, and a <hi>lifting up</hi> of the heart, a making a <hi>ſtay,</hi> and <hi>taking</hi> a ſpiritual ſolace in Heaven with God.</p>
               <p>All Duties we perform muſt be done to the <hi>living God, Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>to ſerve the living God.</hi> If other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, our Duties are but dead works, loathſome as dead Carkaſſes. A living work muſt have for its ſupreme end the living God. God that is the firſt and beſt, muſt have the firſt <hi>aim</hi> and <hi>levelling</hi> to.</p>
               <p>They ſay in Philoſophy, the laſt <hi>end</hi> muſt have the firſt <hi>intending:</hi> The firſt looking at, as the firſt <hi>ground</hi> and mover to any work. And as they ſay in Opticks (the peculiar Art that treats about the nature of ſeeing of Objects) <hi>Quod primo radiat, eſt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47560:41"/>primo viſibile;</hi> that which firſt irradiates, ſends forth that which through the Medium firſt conveys it ſelf to the Eye: This is firſt viſible, and that is light.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt thing</hi> the Eye of Meditation ſhould fix upon, is that <hi>which is the light of lights,</hi> and that is God, who is all Light, Beauty, and Glory. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation ſhould be chiefly acted <hi>to ſee God,</hi> and to aim at glorifying of God above all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Gentiles wiſe men, and great Philoſophers, becauſe their ſpeculations <hi>were not acted</hi> to the glory of God, were <hi>vain imaginations, Rom.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever the aim be, if the glory of God be not the real ſcope; nay if it be not the <hi>maſter mark,</hi> the work is miſcarried; and but a <hi>ravelling</hi> out of Time, a <hi>loſing</hi> of Labour: Meditation muſt make ſure of the right method, and order of aiming the glory of God, like the Sun in the Heavens that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhines all other Lights below and above, and that which is to be ſeen <hi>before, and above all others;</hi> ſo this muſt be eyed and aimed at likewiſe, <hi>far before all other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Three things to be eyed.</hi> Ah we ſhould eye, 1. The Infinite Glories and Reſplendencies of the Eternal and All-ſufficient God. 2. The infinite diſtances and heights he is in above us. 3. And the infinite Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations that ever lie upon us, to exalt him beyond all.</p>
               <p>As in the making of our whole man, whereby he is total owner of us, and proprietor in us. And in our preſerving, whereby we are yet more highly bound. And in the proviſions for our Eternal happineſs, which is far beyond all the former.</p>
               <p>Therefore there's an <hi>abſolute neceſſity</hi> of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47560:42"/>and Order, of <hi>ſtill firſt aiming</hi> every Duty, and Acting at this grand mark; and then to make it the <hi>ſtriving and preſſing</hi> hard of our Spirits to it. O that in my thinkings, in the aſcendings of my thoughts, <hi>this glory of the great God</hi> may ever ſtill aſcend: For no thoughts nor actings can truly aſcend, if they go not up to the bleſſed God and this glory of God; if God goes not up higher in our thinkings, they then go <hi>not higher than ſelf,</hi> and which is <hi>but indeed down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and not <hi>upward</hi> at all. Nay, 'tis a worſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent than that alſo, 'tis Deſtruction and Hell-ward whatſoever is Self-ward, and is not to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the great God. Meditation is <hi>not only to be acted to God</hi> as a Duty, but <hi>as this Duty,</hi> in its pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity and propriety, as being <hi>a peculiar ſtreight line</hi> to God, as a ſingular way for our <hi>taking aim,</hi> this high aim at exalting the praiſes of God.</p>
               <p>Thus did that <hi>rare mark-man,</hi> holy <hi>David,</hi> as it is admirably conſpicuous in the Pſalms, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.12. In the very entrance he lays a ſtrict, a repeated command upon his Soul and all that is <hi>within him, to bleſs, and bleſs, and praiſe God:</hi> Yea not <hi>only lays his Meditation level</hi> to the mark; but raiſes up his ſpirit <hi>to take the pureſt,</hi> the <hi>fulleſt aim;</hi> this both by a <hi>ſelecting</hi> and <hi>improving</hi> of ſpiritual reaſons, <hi>the ſtrongeſt</hi> he could find, and the moſt <hi>quickning Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> he could apply, all that his heart might carry up (in a heavenly flame) the higheſt praiſes of God. Thus you ſhall ſee him very frequently acting his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation up with the greateſt fervour to this exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing highly of God.</p>
               <p>Meditation <hi>is a peculiar viſit</hi> made to the great God; a <hi>Mind, a Thought viſit,</hi> wherein as to a great friend, the Soul, as it were, comes and ſaith to God,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47560:42"/>Lord, <hi>I come to ſee thee,</hi> I now come purpoſely to ſee thee, to <hi>ſpend ſome fit portion of time with thee,</hi> and I come for that <hi>high Honour</hi> and <hi>Obſervance</hi> I am infinitely obliged to tender to thee: Every Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is <hi>giving a freſh viſit,</hi> and thereby a new tender of higheſt <hi>Honour</hi> we own to this beſt of Friends, <hi>This is the firſt end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The next end, is our <hi>highly pleaſing of God,</hi> which by Meditation we are to intend: God will be both <hi>obeyed and pleaſed</hi> with our reſpecting and acting of every appointed way; <hi>Meditation is the beſt way,</hi> the moſt pleaſing way of thinking. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11. <hi>We are to walk worthy of the Lord to all pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Therefore this muſt be performed <hi>to an intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pleaſing,</hi> a due ſerious thinking, a pondering and dwelling of the thoughts upon heavenly things, and chiefly upon the infinite Beauties and Excellencies of God who is the perfect Thought and Heart-knower, the exquiſite Searcher and Obſerver of Soul-actings: But then moſt, when <hi>purpoſely pleaſing is deſigned:</hi> This muſt <hi>very highly pleaſe him,</hi> when we eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deſign pleaſing, with our moſt <hi>wiſhly eyings of him,</hi> yea, <hi>to intend the doing our beſt to pleaſe him, and this, O how ſhould it greatly alſo pleaſe us! Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſal.</hi> 19. laſt <hi>v.</hi> prays for pleaſing God, <hi>Let the Meditations of my heart be acceptable in thy ſight, O Lord my ſtrength and my Redeemer.</hi> So it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be prayed for, but made the <hi>holy aim</hi> of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation with our utmoſt care. <hi>Favourites to great Princes,</hi> what induſtries do they uſe to pleaſe them, eſpecially that their thoughts offered in Counſels may be acceptable? Thus, how did <hi>Philotas,</hi> who was <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great's Favourite; and <hi>Meeenas, Auguſtus</hi> his Favourite? and ſo among our ſelves di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47560:43"/>But how <hi>near goes</hi> it to them. if their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels pleaſe not? as with <hi>Achitophel</hi> when his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel pleaſed not <hi>Abſalom;</hi> and on the contrary with <hi>Huſhai,</hi> when his Counſel pleaſed. So when <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> Counſel was rejected; and how <hi>contrary with Mordecai,</hi> when his Counſels were reſented? Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a Prince is a great encouragement: <hi>But plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a God,</hi> is a ſweet Soul Contentment; it is moſt worthy ſtriving after: O how <hi>unſpeakably ſweet</hi> will the finding and feeling of this, prove in thy heart, when Meditation is performed <hi>purpoſely to pleaſe thy God;</hi> when it runs in a pure ſtream, when thy ſpirit reflecting on its actings in Meditating, makes diſcovery of this <hi>holy aim of high pleaſing</hi> the moſt high God? As the Scripture commands pleaſing, the Saints are peculiarly <hi>commended and greatly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured</hi> for it. As with wiſe and well bred people (obliging and pleaſing in good things) great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is a great praiſe. As <hi>Abel, Enoch,</hi> and others from this character of <hi>pleaſing God.</hi> It <hi>is a heavenly ambition</hi> to earneſtly deſign pleaſing, as in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo in this <hi>walking with God in Meditation.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. The <hi>grand End</hi> of our <hi>own happineſs,</hi> and <hi>working out our own ſalvation,</hi> is the next ſpiritual end, that Meditation as a mighty Engine ſhould ſet on going to effect. It ſhould be ſure to be ordered up, and duly aimed at, acted according to the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and fitneſs</hi> of any way in it, to further this <hi>important end:</hi> Muſing and right Meditation hath <hi>a moſt rare tendency</hi> and <hi>helpfullneſs,</hi> as to the <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out ſalvation.</hi> As it is a <hi>ſanctified means</hi> on Gods part: ſo it muſt be <hi>an earneſtly employed</hi> help on our part: We muſt Meditate <hi>ever ſo</hi> that it may <hi>help on ſalvation;</hi> we muſt mean it and level it ſure, not any way deceive our ſelves, but take <hi>the beſt and ſureſt aim.</hi> Salvation challenges the <hi>beſt eying,</hi> the fulleſt, ſteadieſt, <hi>ſtrongeſt aiming</hi> of every way and help. Soul happineſs muſt not <hi>have ſlender aims,</hi> we cannot have aimings too ſerious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe.</p>
               <p>Let my <hi>aimings here</hi> have the keeneſt edge of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs, be <hi>elevated</hi> the higheſt, made the <hi>firmeſt</hi> and the <hi>moſt extenſive:</hi> Let them take in <hi>univerſally,

               <p>Thus did the <hi>prodigal</hi> (who repreſents the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning ſinner) when ſenſible firſt of his unſpeakable miſery; and thence apprehenſive of the great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable Felicity, the ſo glorious <hi>Goſpel ſalvation; never did he ſo act</hi> any thinking, made <hi>ſuch warm work of it as now.</hi> In like manner the Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. having ſuch a <hi>dreadful awakening</hi> from ſenſe of a loſt condition: O what a pondering of Salvation was that, from a <hi>heart ſo warm'd</hi> and edg'd? <hi>when Extremity of Miſery hath the deepeſt ſenſe, Meditation of Salvation and Recovery hath the higheſt ſeriouſneſs</hi> What can have ſuch a thinking, as <hi>when one thinks for life, and that eternal?</hi> Let Meditation take in 1. <hi>Thoſe Conſiderations</hi> that are <hi>moſt awakening,</hi> that unſpeakable miſery comes upon us by ſins ſo innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: As contracting on the perſon ſuch horrid guilt, and conveying into the heart ſuch helliſh filth.

               <p n="3">3. Then weigh the <hi>great uncertainty</hi> of life, and how certain death caſts every one upon an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtate unavoidably, upon <hi>inconceivable</hi> Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then muſt be weighed the <hi>Mighty Enemies</hi> and multitudes of hinderances lying in the way of eſcaping.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Next come the Conſiderations that are the moſt highly <hi>encouraging</hi> to <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47560:44"/>ſtrait Gate,</hi> ſuch as the Scriptures fullneſs ſupplies. O how great and prevalent are thoſe in the Goſpel, to <hi>wiſe and warm us,</hi> to ſtrengthen and heighten <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</hi> As <hi>Eternal life,</hi> which in the believing heart is already begun, with ſure <hi>promiſe of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on to perfection,</hi> by our yet <hi>co-working with the holy Spirit of Chriſt, working in all his,</hi> which we muſt do continually: <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Work out your own ſalvation, &amp;c.</hi> What may I ſay of <hi>conjunction with God,</hi> by <hi>union with Chriſt,</hi> by Faith of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt, in <hi>juſtification</hi> and <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> of ſin, a moſt glorious <hi>righteouſneſs, reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, adoption,</hi> with a ſure title to Heaven, and the glorious <hi>graces</hi> of Chriſt, his <hi>image, holineſs, wiſdom, life, power, peace</hi> paſſing underſtanding, <hi>joy</hi> unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, with <hi>eſtabliſhment, growth</hi> in <hi>grace,</hi> victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all <hi>Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ah what <hi>wiſhly lookings</hi> ſhould we exerciſe daily at this ſo great ſalvation, and the tranſcendencies and perfections of it; and at laſt ſuch an <hi>outlet of all evils,</hi> ſuch an <hi>inlet of all good,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Crown of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> with all the inconceivable Excellencies of it, and the perfect fruition and viſion of God for ever.</p>
               <p>I have been longer on this than was my purpoſe, yet ſhall crave leave for one thing more, and that which is (after all momentous couſiderations beſides) the greateſt, of ſtrongeſt influence and efficacy, that is the <hi>vaſtneſs, inconceivable vaſtneſs of Eternity:</hi> Not Eternity <hi>meerly in the abſtract,</hi> only conſidered in it ſelf, but in <hi>reference to miſery</hi> or <hi>felicity.</hi> I ſay, to all other inducements adde Eternity; hang on this great weight of Eternity of Miſery and Felicity. Endeavour with thy <hi>utmoſt Art</hi> and <hi>Induſtry,</hi> by all <hi>reſemblances,</hi> to have che livelieſt and moſt <hi>opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive repreſentations of it.</hi>

               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:47560:45"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Breathe thy ſoul</hi> often by healthful exerciſe here, breathe thy ſoul frequently up this <hi>Hill of Eternity.</hi> whatſoever thou meditateſt on, let ſtill this be one Object, entertained in thy <hi>ſerious thoughts,</hi> this vaſt Eternity: Let this have its due time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Holy Meditation hath, beſides the former, ſeveral <hi>other excellent ends</hi> to be aimed at and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to. As Artificers do with their Gold, <hi>beat it out ſometimes to its utmoſt ductility</hi> and <hi>exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs:</hi> Improve this Gold of precious heavenly Objects, beat them out to the utmoſt by this Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, this art of <hi>Divine Meditation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Art of Medtiation</hi> will, like <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple overlaid with Gold, <hi>overlay thy heart</hi> with Chriſts pure Gold, and make it rich and glorious.</p>
               <p>Ah therefore <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> act up thy Meditation to theſe precious ends, and chiefly lay a <hi>mighty ſtreſs</hi> upon that ſo momentous thing, <hi>Eternity</hi> of <hi>Son. Miſery</hi> or <hi>Felicity.</hi>

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Meditation is for a <hi>Principal Improver</hi> of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and heavenly Knowledge: To ſet as it were more Lights on the Golden Table in the Temple of the holy heart, to repleuiſh the Golden Candleſtick with more and better Lights, and glorious burning Lamps, to yield clearer light in the dark heart. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.97, 98, 99. <hi>I am wiſer than my Enemies, for thy Commandments are ever with me;</hi> thats in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47560:46"/>Meditation continually, as <hi>v.</hi> 97. <hi>Thy Law it is my Meditation continually, or all the day, v.</hi> 99. <hi>I have more underſtanding than all my Teachers, for thy Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies are my Meditation,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 100. <hi>I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand more than the Ancients, &amp;c.</hi> Heres an aſſertion in a kind of gradation of the ſucceſsfulneſs of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meditation, namely underſtanding, wiſdom, and excelling in them: Wiſer than his <hi>Enemies,</hi> yea than his <hi>Teachers,</hi> yea than the <hi>Ancients,</hi> that have had longeſt time, largeſt opportunities for greateſt Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and higheſt wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Meditation is the ground, <hi>inlet,</hi> and <hi>improver</hi> of Knowledge. It is not the great and much reading makes the Scholar, but <hi>the ſtudying</hi> and <hi>pondering</hi> that is read. It is not the reading much that makes the knowing Chriſtian, but the <hi>meditating</hi> on what is read: Reading without Meditation is like ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much meat without due chewing; <hi>that</hi> makes a <hi>lean man,</hi> ſo <hi>this</hi> makes a <hi>lean mind.</hi> Many read and hear Much, but underſtand little; becauſe they bring themſelves ſo little under this Ordinance of Meditation. If thou wouldeſt be right excellent in Knowledge, be rich in it, and of a <hi>higher ſtature</hi> in wiſdom than others, as <hi>David</hi> was; ſtrive to write after his rare Copy in abundant Meditating.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Meditation is to make Knowledge <hi>clear and diſtinct.</hi> The Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9. mentions love, its abounding <hi>in Knowledge and Judgment,</hi> and in other places we have mention of <hi>diſcerning and judging.</hi> As to matter of Learning in Arts and Sciences, they have the moſt <hi>clear and diſtinct heads,</hi> have their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>moſt methodical,</hi> diſtinct, and <hi>moſt mellow,</hi> who muſe moſt; contrary, thoſe are the weak and <hi>eaſie Scholars</hi> that muſe leaſt. Divers Chriſtians have
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47560:46"/>their heads full of raw <hi>confuſed things,</hi> a company of <hi>broken ends,</hi> Notions of ſmall uſe to themſelves or others, for want of <hi>due digeſtion</hi> in Meditation: Gold Oar <hi>without refining</hi> and <hi>ſound hammering</hi> is of little uſe; want of Refining <hi>keeps the Metal baſe,</hi> want of Hammering makes it <hi>brittle,</hi> it will not be burniſht up to a full and perfect brightneſs, it will not <hi>obtain a juſt</hi> firmneſs: You cannot have ſo rich <hi>Plate</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tenſils,</hi> no <hi>Veſſels</hi> of it for your ſpecial uſe. The minds of too many Chriſtians <hi>lye ſtrewed over with precious truths,</hi> but neither clear or diſtinct: They are like <hi>Houſes</hi> or <hi>Cloſets</hi> where the rich things, Furnitures and Rarities lie covered over with duſt, or want brightening; or are ſo diſſevered, lie ſo ſcattered and out of place, that ſcarce any thing is for any preſent uſe. So there may be multitudes of Notions and Truths in the mind, but are obſcure and confuſed, a <hi>duſt covers them,</hi> a Curtain is drawn <hi>too far</hi> over them, they are of little <hi>uſe, becauſe Meditation is little uſed:</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation is that, and muſt be that which <hi>methodizes them,</hi> that ſets them in order: Meditation <hi>brightens them</hi> and helps for to make them clear, helps them to a luſtre. Clearneſs, and diſtinctneſs will not be had without giving <hi>down-weight</hi> in due Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And without a clear and diſtinct apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of things they are of little light to thee Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; of leſs influence as to others inſtigation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. A Scholar that hath his <hi>Notions raw and obſcure</hi> can make (at the beſt) but a Bungler. An Artificer, any Tradeſman that hath not his Art, but imperfectly, will make of it but a <hi>mean way to live</hi> and ſubſiſt: he that underſtands his way in Religion, will prove the <hi>wiſe, warm,</hi> and <hi>fruitful</hi> Chriſtian.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:47560:47"/>
               <p n="3">3. Meditation is to be a chief help to the <hi>Repoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> and Treaſury of Truths, to lay and <hi>lock</hi> up ſtore of precious and uſeful Truths more ſure, to fix the lights of truth firm, make them ſtand faſt in the mind. Serious Meditation is a great <hi>advantage</hi> to memory, the Souls Treaſury, that lays up pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Truths in the cloſe conveyances of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and locks the Doors faſt: Such as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate moſt, will have the ſureſt memory for things heavenly.</p>
               <p>Holy <hi>David,</hi> to lay up and hide the Word in his heart, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.11. <hi>did it as, by other,</hi> ſo by the way of Meditation: As in the 15. Verſe, <hi>by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 97. <hi>Continually.</hi> As Truths came to him, ſo made he them ſure by <hi>Meditating:</hi> his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury and Stock grew richer and were kept the ſafer. As in Scholars, not the multitude of <hi>Books,</hi> or great Reading will make a Treaſury of precious Notions, and make them ſure for uſe, <hi>but the due afforded</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to the clearing and fixing of them by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation. Chriſtians that Meditate will be rich in knowledge, and keep it ſure.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> Of the next particular, the fourth end to produce habitual wiſdom.</head>
               <p>THE next particular end of Meditation is to produce <hi>an habitual wiſdom,</hi> in the Mind of a Chriſtian: To be a <hi>moulder and former</hi> of the ſpirit into habitual wiſdom, to ſuperinduce upon the firſt Fundamental (that infuſed wiſdom, given in reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and heart-change) I ſay to the firſt <hi>ſaving</hi> wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to ſuperadde and introduce an <hi>habitual wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> (acquired as they call it) ſuch a wiſdom as makes a Chriſtian more knowingly and wiſely skillful and ready for his way and work; to be beyond a meer Learner, to prove an Artiſt for working out his own ſalvation.</p>
               <p>There is <hi>an infuſed knowledge,</hi> and an infuſed wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, a wiſdom ſtampt upon and given into the Mind in its <hi>firſt renovation</hi> and <hi>converſion,</hi> for then a man ceaſes from being a ſtark fool for ſalvation, as the Scripture makes all in the ſtate of Nature, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.22. <hi>&amp;c. but by converſion and change of heart,</hi> and by union with Chriſt firſt, and then communion with him, <hi>as the wiſdom of his members;</hi> by this they become wiſe, <hi>by an infuſed wiſdom,</hi> whereby they are wiſe indeed, wiſe to ſalvation; wiſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the right and chief end and happineſs is diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the right way and means to that end is <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,</hi> and both <hi>thereupon</hi> deſigned and intended. But this is but a lower meaſure at firſt, a Seed, <hi>a grain
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47560:48"/>of Muſtard-ſeed,</hi> as the Lord compares the ſtate of Grace begun in the heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.32.</p>
               <p>But beſide the former <hi>infuſed wiſdom</hi> there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite <hi>an acquired wiſdom,</hi> a ſuperaddition to the other: This is a <hi>noble help,</hi> and an <hi>improver</hi> of the firſt; that as to <hi>the Eye of Reaſon</hi> and natural wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> and <hi>Exerciſe</hi> brings in an <hi>Habitual wiſdom,</hi> enlarging the Natural. As it is with a Scholar, or an Apprentice to a Trade, Firſt his Tutor or Maſter <hi>infuſes principles</hi> for the wiſdom or skill of his Profeſſion or Trade, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he can a little begin to act or work, make tryal, though but in an imperfect manner; but then by minding and muſing of his inſtructions, and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe he comes at length to an <hi>acquired habit,</hi> to act and work <hi>knowingly</hi> and with facility, becauſe he hath a new wiſdom to underſtand his way. But without minding and muſing <hi>he would never have had the way,</hi> the Art or Trade intended. Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (beſide others) is a ſingular help to <hi>Habitual wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> to attain the Art and Trade of Chriſtianity, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.8. <hi>It is the wiſdom of the wiſe to underſtand his way.</hi> And <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Be not fools but wiſe, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the will of the Lord.</hi> Though they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Chriſtians, by the large meaſure of wiſdom they at their firſt converſion received, yet he calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to ſeek for more, to improve the wiſdom infuſed to farther wiſdom, to a ſpirit of wiſdom, to an <hi>acquired habitual wiſdom,</hi> to be Artiſts in their way, and excel in it. Nothing doth ſo mould the mind into <hi>habitual</hi> wiſdom, as <hi>Meditation;</hi> nothing ſo improves and enlarges ſpiritual underſtanding, makes to underſtand our way and rule of walking, as Meditation, as ſerious and repeated thinkings.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:47560:48"/>
               <p>In natural, or any Civil Affairs, wiſdom in and about them is <hi>not obtained</hi> by bare thinkings, ſlight, ſhort, and tranſient thoughts, or by <hi>ſeldom,</hi> and <hi>now and then</hi> in a fit to think and away, but by <hi>ſerious thoughts,</hi> weighings and ponderings, yea by <hi>frequencies</hi> and conſtancies of thoughts and mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. This way of thinking makes a man wiſe in his way, Trade, or in any buſineſs emergent: Its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be wiſe with this <hi>acquired habit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> without <hi>taking time, making a ſtand,</hi> an abode of thoughts, and thoſe ſerious alſo.</p>
               <p>If we are haſty, ſhort, give not due allowance of Time, and <hi>down weight</hi> of thoughts, ſerious thoughts, we will not come up to <hi>habitual wiſdom;</hi> nor likewiſe we ſhall not act as wiſe Chriſtians are required to do, if habitual wiſdom be wanting: No man can act wiſely, or in <hi>height or eminency</hi> of wiſdom, except he act by a <hi>perfect principle,</hi> as the Angels and Saints in Heaven do, or as a perfect Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, that <hi>hath a perfect</hi> skill and hand at ſome Art or work: The moſt of good Chriſtians, though they have true ſaving wiſdom for the ſubſtance, yet <hi>have little,</hi> very little wiſdom to underſtand their way, little of this <hi>acquired habitual wiſdom.</hi> This is the reaſon of their being ſo frequently to <hi>ſeek,</hi> ſo at a <hi>ſet,</hi> and at a loſs, not knowing what to do: The want now of this wiſdom, is from want of <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> ſerious and frequent muſing to <hi>frame</hi> and <hi>mould</hi> the mind into habitual wiſdom, and ſo increaſing in wiſdom daily.</p>
               <p>That a Chriſtian may be an Artiſt, and have his Trade, have head and hand <hi>adapted</hi> and <hi>readyed</hi> for it, this muſt be by habit, through cuſtom and uſe. There are theſe four ſpecial things, excellent advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in a habit among others.</p>

               <p>A Scholar or an Apprentice put upon Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for <hi>learning an Art</hi> or <hi>Myſtery: At the firſt</hi> he wants (for the preſent) the ability to act as an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> a <hi>Logician,</hi> a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> or the like, and ſo the <hi>facility, pleaſure,</hi> and <hi>conſtancy</hi> cannot be come at; becauſe they are the higher ſteps or ſtories built upon the firſt, that of ability: But when by time he hath <hi>accuſtomed himſelf</hi> in a way, he comes to an <hi>habitual</hi> knowledge and skill, and that habit brings ability to do; and with <hi>ability goes facility,</hi> eaſineſs to act in the art or way; then with <hi>facility is pleaſure</hi> and delight attending, what we do with eaſe is pleaſing.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> Of the fifth End of Meditation to kindle and enflame the Affections.</head>
               <p n="5">5. MEditation hath not only its excellent ends and uſes, relating to the underſtanding and mind, but alſo is of ſingular uſe relating to the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Meditation is that which keeps alive the fire on the Altar, and helps to make it burn: It is that which both <hi>gathers the ſticks,</hi> the <hi>fuel,</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials</hi> for keeping the fire from going out, and that which <hi>kindles them,</hi> blows upon them, and makes them burn and flame up to Heaven.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Levitical Law,</hi> the fire upon the Altar muſt <hi>never go out,</hi> but it was kept burning by the Prieſts <hi>continual minding it:</hi> If they had not <hi>minded</hi> that fire <hi>continually,</hi> it would have gone out. The <hi>fire in the holieſt heart</hi> it muſt be kept in, kept burning continually <hi>by Meditation</hi> and <hi>conſtant mindings:</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation is a <hi>great Heart-warmer,</hi> it <hi>renews</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes</hi> ſpiritual heats, <hi>drives away dulneſs</hi> and <hi>dead heartedneſs,</hi> brings a <hi>new life,</hi> ſtrength and vigour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſpirit, when it faints and flags.</p>
               <p>They ſay of the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> (that <hi>wonder</hi> in Nature) when either by careleſneſs in keeping it, or by ſome accident it loſes its virtue, yet by <hi>laying it ſome good ſpace</hi> of time in the <hi>filings of Steel,</hi> it will again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47560:50"/>its virtues; when the ſpirit of a Chriſtian by not looking well to it, loſes of its heavenly <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>livelineſs,</hi> the way of recovery is by <hi>laying it aſteep</hi> in this ſo warming and quickning Meditation. O how burning and flaming may we often obſerve the ſpirit of the holy Pſalmiſt <hi>David,</hi> in his acting of Meditation? As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.3. <hi>My heart waxed hot within me, and while I was muſing the fire kindled or burned;</hi> Muſing made him hot, yea <hi>burning hot</hi> at the heart. Thus oft in the <hi>beginning</hi> of a Pſalm we find his heart low and diſcouraged, but as this Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing was acted and heightened, his ſpirit grew hotter, and at laſt flies all on a flame, flies up to a very high pitch of heavenly heat. O how do all the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious Practiſers of Meditation, ever and anon <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi> theſe happy heavenly heats, and heart-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements! Ah if all the Saints ſo glorious heart-quickenings were gathered together, what a rich Chain of Pearls, <hi>Pearls of rare Experiences,</hi> would they make up of the heart-warming Efficacies of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation?</p>
               <p>Meditation is a <hi>mighty Engine</hi> to kindle cooling hearts, and make them flame in fervency: The Rule of effecting a buſineſs, <hi>eſpecially</hi> entangled in diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, is firſt as they ſay <hi>Removendo prohibens, &amp; applicando promovens.</hi> That is, by removing the Obſtacles firſt, and then applying furtherances. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation is inſtrumental to heart-warmings and quicknings: Firſt by making a <hi>grand inqueſt</hi> into the occaſions of heart-coolings, and helping to remove them. Then ſecondly, by ſtirring up to the <hi>effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious means</hi> of warmth and quickening; its a rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Schoolmen, that every <hi>Negative is founded in an Affirmative;</hi> that is, every not doing is founded
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47560:50"/>in ſome poſitive act of doing ſomething elſe. And as to the like purpoſe, we ſay in Philoſophy, <hi>The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of one thing is the diſ-intending of another:</hi> Meditation makes an enquiry, and thereby a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of that which hinders ſpiritual heat: The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing of fire and heat in Nature, is either by <hi>caſting on</hi> much water, or <hi>ſmothering</hi> it, by either throwing on much incombuſtible matter, or <hi>hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the airs openneſs, and its free coming to it, which choaks it, or by <hi>withdrawing</hi> the Fuel upon which it feeds. 1. Meditation finds heart-coolings to proceed from a giving way to and the preſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing of ſome corruption or luſt, that like water quenches the fire. They ſay that ſome rich ſpirits and rare extractions, if taken in ſome acid or ſour Liquor, the ſowr Liquor turns the edge of thoſe ſpirits, and fruſtrates their operation: As <hi>cold clammy humours</hi> at the head of the Nerves or Sinews, ſtop the courſe of the <hi>Animal ſpirits,</hi> and occaſion the Numm, or dead Palſey: Or as ſome <hi>cold Poiſon</hi> taken in, quenches the vivifical heat and ſpirits, endangers if not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces death: So a corruption or ſin let out and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven way unto, chills, and cools, and quenches the <hi>heart-heat,</hi> and the longer yielded to, the cooler will the affections grow.</p>
               <p>A Sin given way unto, <hi>damps</hi> the heart-warming Ordinances, <hi>quenches</hi> the heart-warming ſpirit, <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs</hi> thy communion with a heart-quickening Chriſt. <hi>Hoſeah— Whoredom and Wine, and new Wine take away the heart:</hi> what is there ſpoken of a more total taking away the heart in evil men, is true of a <hi>gradual</hi> taking away the heart, the heat and livelineſs in godly men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Meditation on due Enquiry finds heart-coolings
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47560:51"/>to ariſe from Chriſtians <hi>ſmothering</hi> their heat with heaping up <hi>buſineſſes</hi> and troubles upon themſelves, launching too far into the Seas of worldly Affairs and over-carings. The <hi>thorny ground</hi> had the <hi>word choaked by cares and affairs of this life:</hi> what cares and buſineſs doth to the Word, it doth to the hearts warmth; can thou entangle thy ſelf in the matters of the World, and thou wilt cool apace. The far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man Travels from the Sun Northward, the cooler he is: Turn your face from Heaven to the World, go far, and you come to not only cool, but freeze. Or as <hi>ſhe</hi> in the Roman ſtory that out of a deſign to enrich her ſelf, contracted with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to betray the Caſtle, for that which the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had on their left arm (meaning their Golden <hi>Bracelets</hi>) but the Souldiers, inſtead of their <hi>Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,</hi> threw their Shields on her, whereby ſhe inſtead of being enriched was ſmothered.</p>
               <p>To engage in a <hi>throng</hi> is the way to be ſmothered: The world will ſmother thee if thou engageſt too far, it will ſtill cool thy <hi>heart-heat,</hi> make thee of a warm and lively, a cool dead-hearted Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>Fiſh</hi> call'd the <hi>Torpedo,</hi> if you touch it with your bare leg, or hand, it preſently nums that Limb that toucht it: Touch with thy heart upon the world, it will leave it num; there's no ſuch way to keep in thy heat, as to keep out the world, avoid the danger of a Crowd of buſineſſes and cares.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Meditation upon ſearching, diſcovers the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of heat is from decay in heart-warming Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, where the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhines warm upon thee, whereby the <hi>Soul-heat</hi> is both preſerved and encreaſt.</p>
               <p>Abatings of <hi>heavenly heat,</hi> ariſe from drawing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47560:51"/>away the <hi>fuel</hi> of heavenly duties, or thy own <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsneſs</hi> and negligence in them.</p>
               <p>If a man ſhall caſt away his Cloaths, leave his food, and decline the means of preſerving heat and life, he muſt needs grow cold, if he be not quickly kill'd. If a man reads not, meditates not, prays not, hears not, or is negligent and formal herein, he muſt needs like a dying man grow cold: It much depends upon the lively <hi>performance</hi> of <hi>holy duties,</hi> that you keep <hi>Heart-warm,</hi> or that you <hi>decay</hi> in your <hi>fervour</hi> by careleſneſs in the means: Meditation will mind you of this, and put you upon mending it in time.</p>
               <p>The Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Rev.</hi> 2. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook or left his firſt Love, his <hi>Heart-heat;</hi> and Chriſt intimates, he had left off his <hi>firſt works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Meditation is inſtrumental to ſpiritual <hi>vivacity</hi> and warmth, <hi>applicando promovens,</hi> by helping to apply the things, that recover and promote heat and livelineſs. I will name but two things in this, 1. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation mightily helps here, by being a <hi>great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument</hi> of ſearching out, applying and working home the <hi>Scriptures Heart-warming conſiderations,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>quickning</hi> Spirit, the inditer of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, that knows what things are moſt proper and proportionate for recovering or increaſing heat, what he hath left upon record to uſe in this caſe.</p>
               <p>As conſideration is the <hi>firſt mover</hi> in the ſoul, ſo <hi>warm conſiderations</hi> are the <hi>firſt warmers:</hi> O what a <hi>latitude and fullneſs</hi> hath Meditation to fetch <hi>heart-warming</hi> conſiderations from! If the <hi>Eye looks up to the Heavens,</hi> what abundance of Heavenly bodies, for conveyance of light and heat it ſoon diſcovers?
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47560:52"/>But if the eye of Meditation looks into the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>what a proſpect of various rare and glorious paſſages is there to be found of Conſiderations?</hi> Like abundance of <hi>richeſt Spirits, higheſt Cordials,</hi> and preparations of all ſorts, in Artiſts Shops and Cloſets. O what <hi>heart-warming</hi> conſiderations can Meditation fetch and apply from the infinitely bleſſed God, his infinite Excellencies, Eternal Love, ſweetneſs unſpeakable, of the ſenſe of his Favour, and the like: Ah what <hi>heart-warming</hi> conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to behold him and view him all over, in all he is in his unexpreſſible Glories? In all he hath done, <hi>whereby he hath out done all that ever was or ſhall be done?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What warming conſiderations in reſpect of the <hi>Holy Spirit, the grand and mighty applyer of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> by his habitation and operation? What in reſpect <hi>of the Word, the Precepts, Promiſes, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and Examples in it</hi> of ſundry ſorts, all for our help and comfort? What of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> ſo ſure and ſweet? What in reſpect of <hi>our ſelves, ſouls ſtate,</hi> and all the great concerns of it in ſalvation? Meditation can never want <hi>heart-warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiderations,</hi> can bring <hi>ſtores of Arguments</hi> of all ſorts, and blow upon them, to make the heart kindle and flame, although it was chill and dead, and never ſo low brought.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>this Engine of heavenly Meditation</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces heart-warmth and vivacity, by taking thee <hi>out of the ſhade and cool,</hi> and leading into the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine of <hi>Heart-warming Ordinances,</hi> wherein the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſes, and ſhines warm,</hi> and his <hi>quickning ſpirit</hi> breathes <hi>warm</hi> upon thee, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5. As a cure of cooling and decaying Love, Chriſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47560:52"/>counſels the Angel of that Church of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> firſt to <hi>repent,</hi> and then to <hi>do his firſt works.</hi> Negligence in holy Duties, omiſſion of them, or <hi>remiſneſs</hi> in them, introduced a <hi>cooling</hi> of his Love; therefore what was loſt by not doing, muſt be recovered by ſuch a doing as the firſt was; that his firſt works done again, might be a <hi>rekindler</hi> of his <hi>firſt Love:</hi> Diſuſe of Exerciſe abates the natural heat and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, but returning to it, will again recover it. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation when it finds the <hi>failure</hi> and defect, will provoke and engage to the juſt Remedy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
               <p>I have now diſpatcht at length this ſecond End of Meditation, its being for <hi>quickning</hi> the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The next follows.</p>

               <p>MEditation, as it is to be a helper to warm the affections, ſo for <hi>a means to ſtrengthen and fix the holy purpoſes and reſolutions of the will:</hi> It is not a <hi>wavering and weak purpoſe,</hi> or a <hi>feeble reſolution</hi> will ſerve for a <hi>foundation</hi> for <hi>building ſo high as Heaven,</hi> for carrying on ſo <hi>great</hi> and <hi>hard</hi> a work as ſoul-ſaving.

Holy <hi>David</hi> often in the Pſalms tells us of his <hi>will,</hi> his <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of heart,</hi> and his <hi>heart was fixed, Pſal.</hi> 119. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 108.1.

               <p n="1">1. Of fixing and <hi>deeper rooting of the grand ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral purpoſe</hi> of pleaſing and glorifying God, and working out our own ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It's greatly inſtrumental for <hi>corroboration</hi> and for <hi>ſtrengthening</hi> the <hi>leſſer Roots of derivative pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,</hi> that ſpring from the <hi>grand purpoſe,</hi> that are the particular <hi>Abettors</hi> and <hi>Helpers</hi> of the main and general forementioned purpoſe. In every holy heart there is planted at firſt converſion, <hi>that fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental and noble purpoſe</hi> of pleaſing and glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God in all things without exception: This pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe alſo muſt be <hi>often renewed,</hi> have its <hi>reiterations</hi> for <hi>corroboration.</hi> There muſt be alſo <hi>derivative</hi> and <hi>ſubſervient</hi> purpoſes, particular purpoſes, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to advancing the main purpoſe, and the Souls chief end and intendment, purpoſes for particular ſoul-concerns, particular Duties either <hi>reſpecting Mortification</hi> of particular corruptions, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>ſelf-denials,</hi> or that reſpect <hi>particular graces</hi> and <hi>duties,</hi> in the ſeaſons required for them.

               </p>
               <p>The Scriptures give <hi>frequent inſtances</hi> of both <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> purpoſes this way practiſed. Firſt of the general and grand purpoſe; thus <hi>David</hi> very often in the Pſalms declares, ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.8. <hi>I will keep thy Statutes;</hi> there's a general purpoſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47560:53"/>
                  <hi>ſuperadded</hi> to the firſt purpoſe that he did when he firſt gave up his heart in converſion to his God: Thus in the 69. <hi>Verſe</hi> of this <hi>Pſalm, I will keep thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts with my whole heart;</hi> there's another general purpoſe. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.9. <hi>I will walk before the Lord in the Land of the living,</hi> there's another of his <hi>added</hi> general purpoſes for ſerving God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.57. <hi>Thou art my portion, O Lord, I have ſaid I will keep thy word.</hi> There he tells you what he had done in the time paſt, he had ſaid, as in the former he ſaith, what <hi>he would do for the future.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in the 106. <hi>Verſe,</hi> he tells you what a purpoſe he had taken, ſuch as had a confirmation of an Oath, or as ſome expreſs, it had <hi>quaſi vim Juramenti,</hi> as it were the ſtrength or force of an Oath, yea here tells you what he did in time paſt, and what he <hi>will do for the future: I have ſworn,</hi> there's the time paſt: <hi>And will perform,</hi> there's purpoſe for the future: A <hi>recalling</hi> of his old purpoſe, and a <hi>renewing</hi> of a freſh purpoſe to back the old.

               <p>Purpoſes and Reſolutions general and particular, and the frequent uſe of them: Linking purpoſe to purpoſe, ſtrong purpoſes are ſtill neceſſary for every Chriſtian that will work out ſalvation: Yet all <hi>muſt</hi> be done in the <hi>ſtrength of Chriſt,</hi> elſe they will not hold, but wear out, and ſnap aſunder.</p>
               <p>Now Meditation is rarely inſtrumental herein.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Inſtrumental to make our purpoſes <hi>wiſe,</hi> we muſt ponder and conſider before we purpoſe; raſh <hi>purpoſes</hi> and more ſudden, without due bottoming in a <hi>previous Meditating,</hi> will prove but miſcarryings and abortions. They are like fooliſh building on the Sand, they ſoon fail: <hi>A purpoſe, the more delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, the more durable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Meditation helps to make <hi>purpoſes ſtrong</hi> and <hi>firm;</hi> we have need of <hi>ſtrong purpoſes</hi> for the great things of Eternal life: we have ſtrong oppoſition from corruption within, and temptation without: Meditation helps mightily to ſtrengthen Reſolution.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By repairing to your ſpiritual Magazine, and thence fetching forth <hi>ſtrong ſpiritual Arguments</hi> to raiſe <hi>ſtrong Reſolutions and Purpoſes.</hi> Arguments out of the rich ſtores of Scripture, of all ſorts and natures, to relieve the weakneſs of the <hi>will</hi> in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing: Meditation acts a <hi>Divine reaſoning, diſputes you into a purpoſing,</hi> when it ſhews you have ſo much for it, and nothing at all againſt it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Meditation <hi>ſelects and ſharpens Arguments,</hi> ſets home, and <hi>improves</hi> them upon the conſcience, that you muſt yield, muſt reſolve, and firmly, ſtrongly, in ſuch matters as none can be higher.</p>
               <p>O how many ſtrong and unanſwerable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can Meditation come furniſht with, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute <hi>againſt carnal unreſolvedneſs,</hi> to plead for your
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47560:55"/>acting ſtrong Reſolutions for any part of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned Duty? What weight can it put into the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance to caſt the Scale for Gods and your Souls inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt? I need not name the heads of Arguments, ſuch as the indiſpenſible neceſſity of the Precept and means, the great ſinfulneſs of unwillingneſs, the excellency of the thing, with the ſweetneſs, comfort, confidence, and advantages attending it: But this I ſhall adde, The excellency of a Chriſtian lies chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>in his will;</hi> and the excellency of that will is in the <hi>height of its purpoſe</hi> and <hi>reſolution,</hi> freeſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and choice, firmeſt reſolution and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the work he came into the world to do: And the <hi>great Aſſiſtant,</hi> on our part, of holy reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is holy Meditation, applying fit reaſons to ſtir up reſolution, and inſtigating to all thoſe ways that breed and cheriſh it. And this latter is another par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular whereby Meditation is a relief and fortifier of good reſolutions and purpoſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Meditation, I ſay, is a <hi>great ſtrengthener</hi> and <hi>ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſher</hi> of holy <hi>purpoſes,</hi> both as it is a directive, and inſtigative; as teaching us what are the ways to help us in purpoſing, and as inſtigating and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the Ordinances and means, that will water the Plants of holy purpoſes, make them root deep, and ſhoot up high, flouriſh and bear fruit. If our purpoſes are weak; if our hearts in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſings are apt to ſlip out of joint; no ſooner ſet, but as ſoon ſlipt, or ready to diſlocate and be out of joint; what remedy then have we but conſideration or falling to meditate, to make a true inquiry firſt of the right and proportionate ways of healing <hi>this will-malady,</hi> this heart-infirmity? 2. And then Meditation inſtigates to a due uſe of diſcovered
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47560:56"/>helps, of infirm and inconſtant reſolutions, draws you to and <hi>through the whole circle</hi> of means, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes you to try every Remedy to cure theſe abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive purpoſes. It directs and leads you to all the Ordinances of help, to the promiſes that make over help, to a Chriſt and all his Fulneſs of help, to the holy Spirit for his applying effectually of help, to ſtirring up Faith, to acting recumbencies and reſtings on Chriſt in the Promiſes, to ſtirring up our ſelves, to humble our ſelves for our failings in our purpoſes, and to ſtrive againſt them, watch our hearts ſlipperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to labour keeping our reſolutions and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes better. In Natures order, doing is <hi>upon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving, <hi>reſolving upon conſidering;</hi> ſo in grace, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming is upon purpoſing, purpoſing ariſes from pondering and meditating. The Saints in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that acted the higheſt reſolutions, exerciſed the deepeſt Meditations, as we ſee, in that man after Gods own heart. Fits and flaſhes of <hi>Phanſie,</hi> never breed firm purpoſings; but ſuch reſolutions that lie longeſt aſteep in due preceding Meditation, have the deepeſt tincture and holding Colour. Longer I have been upon this particular, as a point more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, becauſe the art of raiſing and fixing, height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and improving holy reſolutions, is ſuch a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py fruit of Divine Meditation, ordered to that bleſſed End.</p>

               <p n="4">4. MEditation is for a conſtant <hi>keeper up</hi> and <hi>ſupporter of</hi> the Chriſtian courſe, as to the evenneſs of this Golden thread, without decays, ſinkings, ſtands, and interruptions. 2. As to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements and goings on to perfection. 3. And as to conflictings with Enemies and Oppoſitions.</p>
               <p>This was holy <hi>Paul</hi>'s practice, by ſtill taking in the higheſt provoking conſiderations, minding and due pondering of them; it made him to labour ſo abundantly, to preſs ſo hard <hi>to the mark, forgetting the things behind, and looking to the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He meditated on the <hi>Price of the high calling,</hi> kept his Eye on <hi>the Crown of righteouſneſs,</hi> he kept his Eye alway on the ſtores and varieties of Goſpel encouragements.</p>
               <p>A Chriſtian of the <hi>greateſt conſideration</hi> will ever keep up beſt <hi>his evenneſs and conſtancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>New freſh Meditations are new Soul feedings, new meals, which adde new ſtrength and vigour; they make a Chriſtian like <hi>Elijah,</hi> when he had eaten, to travel with new ſtrength to <hi>Horeb</hi> the Mount of God.</p>
               <p>There is <hi>a Beaſt in the Weſt-Indies</hi> they call <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritia,</hi> which ſignifies ſloth, for its ſtrange ſlow pace, which is going <hi>fourteen days</hi> a ſtones caſt;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47560:57"/>and they have contrarily a glorious Bird call'd the <hi>Bird of Paradiſe,</hi> that is ſeen generally flying, and in a very expedite motion.</p>
               <p>Divers for <hi>running the bleſſed race of</hi> Godlineſs, go <hi>creeping</hi> ſlowly, making little haſte or progreſs, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they meditate little.

               <p n="3">3. THe third and laſt End or Uſe of Meditation named, was in reſpect of <hi>others:</hi> As the former ends were in reference firſt to God, then towards our ſelves: So this we come now unto, is in reſpect of others.</p>
               <p>Meditation in reference to others, to perſons of all ſorts, is to fill the treaſure of the heart with <hi>good things,</hi> and to <hi>fit</hi> the good man out of the good treaſure of his heart, to bring them forth to furniſh others, and be ſerviceable to their ſpiritual condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Luke— The good man out of the good treaſure of his heart bringeth forth good things.</hi> He firſt lays in a good treaſure, ſtores himſelf with the riches of heavenly treaſure, and then brings it out: It is not <hi>a work meerly of phanſie and imagination,</hi> but chiefly of Meditation and Conſideration: Imagination
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47560:57"/>takes in varieties of things in a promiſcuous manner, without differencing or diſtinguiſhing. Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes a <hi>collection,</hi> Meditation makes a <hi>ſelection</hi> and <hi>dijudication:</hi> Meditation obſerves what preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things are offered us, and lays them up, and diſcerns what are not precious, and lays them by; yea by Meditation there is not only an old ſtore laid in, but there will be alſo an adding of new. It is this rare Art of Meditation that both founds and fills the treaſury with old and new: Phanſie and Imagination, as it is in divers, may fill the mind <hi>with traſh</hi> but not <hi>with Treaſure,</hi> with things <hi>that gliſter,</hi> but are <hi>not Gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is this Meditation that <hi>makes diſcerning</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the precious and the vile, that takes up on ſearching the treaſure found and diſcern'd, and lays it up in the treaſury of a good heart: And this is <hi>firſt</hi> for the good mans own ſtore and ſupply, but then it is <hi>alſo</hi> for to enable him to bring forth, for others uſe and help, to bring forth in firſt diſcourſe, that is ſpiritual and ſavoury for the <hi>Nature,</hi> and that likewiſe is <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> and <hi>ſutable</hi> for the occaſion offer'd, to bring and ſhew forth the <hi>Apples of Gold in their Pictures of Silver,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of a word ſpoken in ſeaſon; likewiſe to hold forth things that are exemplary as to a fruitfulneſs in walking, to bring forth the good things of light to ſhine out, light of <hi>precious edifying</hi> truths, and light of rich and <hi>rare experiences,</hi> and to bring out the good things of a heavenly, quickning, comforting, and encouraging Nature. Meditation, as it is the great way of gathering up things that are uſeful, and filling the heart-treaſury; ſo it is to be the way of <hi>direction</hi> to open it, and bringing forth in diſcourſe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47560:58"/>the good things ſtored up: And by this imparting them to others, we our ſelves have a double advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage often following. 1. A clearer and more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct apprehenſion; as Silver and Gold brighten by uſe, not by lying up. 2. A <hi>warmer</hi> and <hi>livelier Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> and when they come forth <hi>warmer</hi> by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing, they are the apter <hi>to warm others</hi> and make their hearts burn within them.</p>
               <p>This then is one End, one great and excellent End of this ſo excellent way of Meditation: <hi>That as face anſwereth to face in water, ſo heart may anſwer heart in warmth.</hi> When things have been well warmed in the Forge and Furnace firſt of <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and then in our <hi>Communication;</hi> Fire may kindle Fire, and one warm heart may occaſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Diſcourſe, that is the <hi>meer product and fruit of Phanſie and Memory,</hi> and hath not ſome riſe and tincture of warm Meditation; ſome diſcovery of <hi>heart-heat</hi> is like <hi>flaſhes of lightning,</hi> or the <hi>ſhining of the Moon;</hi> they make a ſhew, but warm not; <hi>No body is warmer by the one, no heart is warmer by the other.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the ſeveral kinds or ways of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</head>
               <p>WE now, from the divers Ends of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, proceed to the ſeveral kinds, or ways of it.</p>
               <p>Meditation is either that which is more ſet and ſolemn, or that which is more ſudden and ſhort. 1. That which is more ſet and ſolemn; and this is either the more ordinary and daily, or that which is extraordinary, upon ſome more peculiar Occaſions, both which the Scriptures hold forth in the record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Precepts and Precedents therein.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The neceſſity of daily Meditation.</hi> The firſt way of ſolemn Meditation, is that <hi>which ſhould be daily:</hi> That as private Praying and other Duties, are a Chriſtians daily ways of exerciſing himſelf in Godlineſs and walking with God; ſo holy Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <hi>is one golden path in the great Road to Heaven,</hi> one way of <hi>breathing his ſoul</hi> daily up the <hi>Hill of Eternity,</hi> and <hi>meeting with God</hi> in the Mount.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. The holy Prophet makes it a Character of the bleſſed man, that he <hi>Meditates in the Law of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47560:59"/>God day and night:</hi> Where we have held forth, as they ſay, <hi>Gratiam &amp; Gradum,</hi> the Grace and the Degree of that Grace; the Grace, he doth Meditate; the Degree, day and night: Thus much hereby muſt then be implyed, that as it is to be performed often, ſo it cannot well be performed by the Rule in this Scripture paſſage, if <hi>every day</hi> in courſe there be not ſomething done this way, either more or leſs; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we cannot give God and our ſouls concerns <hi>too much meaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. He tells us his daily practice, to Meditate both in the day and night. Now his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, being a King and under ſuch varieties of <hi>important Affairs;</hi> ſo many and ſo great as none can have more: And if he had ſtill ſuch cares, troubles, and dangers attending, might not theſe have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed to ſome abatement of his conſtancy? but it did not: This therefore leaves all ſorts of perſons <hi>without excuſe,</hi> none being able to alledge, <hi>that which he could,</hi> or not <hi>more urgencies</hi> of daily occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: There is no doubt, that as it is a work lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every one, <hi>ſo ſure as the day returns</hi> and the freſh buſineſſes of it; ſo this Meditating of right doth challenge for it ſelf <hi>ſome fit ſeaſon and portion</hi> of the day, being one of the great buſineſſes for the Souls help.</p>
               <p>As no Chriſtian can plead exemption from this <hi>daily incumbency, this daily ſoul affair;</hi> ſo no good prudent Chriſtian can conceive, but he may find out in the <hi>revolution</hi> of the day, ſome at leaſt fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for ſerious Meditation: Or if not in the day time (the time of action and avocation) yet in the night <hi>upon the Bed,</hi> the time of reſt and freedom. What was ſaid of that great Warriour <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:47560:59"/>making his way into <hi>Italy</hi> over the high rocky Mountains, the <hi>Alpes,</hi> with Fire and Vinegar, <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal will either find a way, or make one;</hi> and is ſaid of Love, <hi>It will creep if it cannot go;</hi> a good heart will find or make its way over Mountains of Difficulties and Buſineſs, to have Communion with Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Ah it is moſt ſad, if I can allow <hi>ſo many hours</hi> in the night for reſt and ſleep, <hi>ſo many</hi> in the day <hi>for buſineſs</hi> and <hi>emergencies,</hi> ſo many for <hi>eating and drinking,</hi> ſo many for <hi>company and diſcourſe,</hi> yea ſo much time for <hi>pleaſure, play,</hi> for <hi>trivial things next to nothing,</hi> it may be for things <hi>worſe than nothing,</hi> for <hi>ſins and luſts,</hi> and that no part of the <hi>twenty four hours</hi> muſt be afforded for ſerious thinking, thinking of things <hi>ten thouſand times</hi> more momentous and concerning than the <hi>total ſum</hi> of matters, that ſweep away and ſwallow up precious time ſo much. The good Chriſtian cannot but at leaſt cloſe with the <hi>eternal obligation</hi> of this duty: And the <hi>wiſe and fruitful Chriſtian</hi> cannot but yield ſome complyance with the practice of it, and let this come in for its <hi>due ſhare</hi> in the time of the day, as <hi>one important</hi> bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to be diſpatcht, and that muſt ſtill contribute to the <hi>right making of it up,</hi> and <hi>improvement</hi> of it. After ſome evidence of the <hi>equity</hi> of this daily Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I come to ſpeak to <hi>the Nature</hi> and <hi>way</hi> of this Meditation. This being of all other ſorts the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, which therefore challenges a more diſtinct and careful handling.</p>
               <p>If Chriſtians <hi>very well</hi> underſtand not this way, or <hi>fall very ſhort of the due manner and order of it,</hi> the work is neither ſo <hi>pleaſant</hi> or <hi>ſucceſsful</hi> as it might be and ſhould be, and queſtionleſs is to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47560:60"/>ſuch as are the great Artiſts herein, ſuch as have been well practiſed and experienced in it. I ſhall therefore now endeavour to ſhew the Nature of it, and ſomething of a Method of due proceeding in it.</p>
               <p>In general, it is that daily exerciſe whereby we ſingle out purpoſely ſome ſpiritual or uſeful matters, to act the ſearchings and ponderings, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our ability and <hi>opportunity</hi> of the day we can exerciſe for our ſpiritual advantage.</p>
               <p>The Mind is a Spring <hi>alway running</hi> in thinkings, a Wheel <hi>alway turning,</hi> a Forge <hi>alway framing,</hi> a Wing <hi>ever moving;</hi> it is the moſt <hi>active, buſie, nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing</hi> in all the world, therefore hath the greateſt need to be well lookt unto, to be kept, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. <hi>With all keeping keep thy heart;</hi> to be guided with the beſt skill and care, with the ſteadieſt and ſtiffeſt rein, like a Horſe of <hi>higheſt metal,</hi> ready to run away with his Rider; it will run <hi>wildly away,</hi> and carry the ſoul into <hi>vanity, folly,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-miſchieving.</hi> Meditation is a <hi>ſpiritual rein and curb,</hi> and the peculiar deſigned way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, rectifie, and order it.</p>
               <p>To bring the hearts <hi>thinking power</hi> into the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſubſerviency,</hi> the greateſt uſefulneſs to the main, to the Souls grand intereſt: Therefore there is a great neceſſity upon every good heart, of daily and much Meditating.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Meditating</hi> 5. On our part, by our <hi>uſe of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi> and the <hi>Word and Promiſes,</hi> and that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>holineſs</hi> whereby we come to <hi>union</hi> and <hi>communion</hi> with God, glorifie him, and obtain ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; Faith as the <hi>inſtrument of receiving Chriſt,</hi> and both Faith and Holineſs, or the <hi>graces of Chriſt</hi> as our <hi>principles of life and power,</hi> to <hi>live unto God,</hi> and growing up to <hi>perfection</hi> againſt all <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt thing <hi>according to the rule of beſt wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> which lays the <hi>ſureſt foundation</hi> in any courſe, is firſt to take into moſt ſerious conſideration, the ſupream and chief end, and to act a freſh ſetting up before us, that <hi>Maſter-Mark,</hi> and <hi>ſcope</hi> of the <hi>moſt high God,</hi> and the <hi>glorifying of him,</hi> to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued as we can <hi>through the whole courſe of the day;</hi> I ſay, this ſo high <hi>incumbency</hi> and <hi>duty</hi> of looking ſtill at, and levelling all to <hi>the glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:47560:62"/>
               <p>Meditation of this <hi>glorifying God,</hi> for pure, live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and higheſt advancings of it, this is the Souls beſt operation, and runs <hi>moſt parallel</hi> to the <hi>perfect work of Heaven. Heavens higher acting</hi> is Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the <hi>moſt bleſſed God,</hi> for the moſt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent <hi>exaltings of his glory:</hi> The Rule of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is, <hi>To do all to the glory of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. And this Rule muſt therefore have its place and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er here; therefore this <hi>daily Meditation</hi> muſt take it in, and ſet it up. It muſt be every ones wiſdom to bottom our <hi>day Meditation,</hi> with the ſtill <hi>eying of,</hi> and <hi>aiming at</hi> the <hi>glorifying of</hi> the <hi>moſt high God.</hi> To begin with the <hi>freſh thoughts,</hi> and alſo the <hi>warmeſt frame</hi> of Spirit, for farthering the ſupream end, the <hi>glory of God,</hi> and with it, as <hi>fit to be annext unto it,</hi> that which is wrapt up with it, our own <hi>Eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</hi> Philoſophers and Divines have ſeveral <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims</hi> about the Supream End: To mention ſome of them to help us here: As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Finis ſummus, eſt maxime appetibilis;</hi> The <hi>chief End</hi> is of all things elſe <hi>the moſt deſirable, Pſal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.9. If (as it is moſt ſure) it be <hi>moſt deſirable,</hi> then this, as was ſaid before, is the <hi>chief point of wiſdom,</hi> to <hi>chiefly eye and aim</hi> at this chief End: and then ſure it is <hi>moſt proper in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi> of our <hi>daily Meditation,</hi> to mind this one of the firſt, and how to advance towards it anew, on the opportunity of a new day begun upon us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, there is <hi>another Rule given,</hi> which is <hi>Finis ultimus praeſcribit Regulas totius vitae, ſed ipſi fini nonpraeſcribitur;</hi> That the <hi>laſt</hi> or <hi>chief End</hi> preſcribes or gives the Rules of the whole life, or courſe, but the laſt End hath no Rules preſcribed to it.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:47560:62"/>
               <p>In <hi>all caſes the End</hi> of any thing, that <hi>gives</hi> the Rules to that thing.</p>
               <p>Thus that hath <hi>profit and livelyhood</hi> for its End, that <hi>profit and livelyhood</hi> gives the <hi>Rules</hi> to the <hi>Trader,</hi> and all his actings <hi>are reduced</hi> and <hi>ordered</hi> to <hi>profit</hi> and <hi>ſubſiſtence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That of mens <hi>particular</hi> or a <hi>Nations intereſt,</hi> as it is called. The <hi>particular intereſt of perſons</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: Or the <hi>Publick intereſt</hi> and <hi>chief good,</hi> that gives the Rules to <hi>private men,</hi> or to <hi>States-men;</hi> their <hi>actings</hi> muſt be to their <hi>intereſt,</hi> the chief <hi>good</hi> or <hi>End:</hi> So the Souls <hi>grand intereſt,</hi> real higheſt End and Intereſt, gives <hi>all the Rules</hi> to all a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans wiſe, truly wiſe actings.</p>
               <p>Thus in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13. <hi>I preſs hard to the Mark;</hi> firſt he ſet up the Mark, or that was ſet up before him to aim at: And this made him <hi>preſs hard,</hi> and <hi>run</hi> in the <hi>right way</hi> ſo earneſtly, made him uſe all the right means, and the due manner for attaining to it.</p>
               <p>So <hi>this of eying the Supreme End,</hi> as the right ſure way, as the <hi>ſure wiſdom for a mans ſelf, Prov.</hi> 9.12. this ſhould be firſt taken in, and come under freſh conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. That which gives the firſt riſe to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that which muſt <hi>vitally influence,</hi> and <hi>ſtrongly inſtigate,</hi> yea <hi>fix and ſtabliſh</hi> our whole courſe.</p>
               <p>The courſe riſes or falls, ſtrengthens or weakens, bears up or breaks off in evenneſs, or unevenneſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our more or leſs lively, and freſh lookings at, and ponderings of the chief End.</p>
               <p>This we ſee in all undertakings, the <hi>manner, earneſtneſs, and evenneſs</hi> of any courſe, is from the <hi>manner, earneſtneſs,</hi> and <hi>evenneſs</hi> of mans <hi>eyings</hi> of his <hi>chief aim</hi> and <hi>intereſt</hi> deſigned in it.</p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:47560:63"/>
               <p>In a <hi>Watch</hi> and divers <hi>artificial Motions,</hi> the <hi>even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>expediteneſs</hi> of the <hi>motion</hi> is from <hi>evener</hi> or <hi>unevener,</hi> ſtronger or weaker drawing of the Spring, the <hi>firſt mover.</hi> Thus is it in godlineſs, a Chriſtians <hi>motions</hi> are anſwerable to <hi>his eyings</hi> more or leſs of the <hi>main end:</hi> Chriſtians complain of their daily dead-heartedneſs, and unevenneſs; it much ariſes from the <hi>ſo little</hi> or <hi>liſtleſs lookings</hi> at the main Mark. <hi>Paul</hi> lookt <hi>earneſtly,</hi> and he preſt <hi>hard:</hi> In <hi>Archery,</hi> thoſe who eye the Mark moſt <hi>earneſtly</hi> and <hi>ſteadily</hi> hit the <hi>ofteneſt</hi> and <hi>fulleſt.</hi> The wiſeſt Chriſtian is the moſt <hi>earneſt, equal eyer</hi> of the <hi>main End.</hi> There be many <hi>particulars</hi> in this <hi>head,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>leiſure</hi> may have their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ponderings.</p>
               <p>The variety will breed delight, and <hi>ſet an edge</hi> upon the Spirit, apt to grow <hi>heavy</hi> and <hi>weary;</hi> they are ſuch as theſe: As the conſiderations of the moſt <hi>high God,</hi> in all his <hi>infinite Glories</hi> and <hi>Perfections:</hi> His All-ſufficiency, in his <hi>Knowledge, Wiſdom, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Righteouſneſs,</hi> and the reſt: But chiefly in his ſo <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>unchangeable Love,</hi> and <hi>Riches</hi> of <hi>Free Grace:</hi> The <hi>Infinite obligations,</hi> eternally lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, for <hi>glorifying</hi> and <hi>exalting</hi> of him: The <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite excellencies</hi> and <hi>fullneſs</hi> of the <hi>ſecond Perſon,</hi> and his infinite Love, in undertaking with his Father, to <hi>Redeem loſt ſinners:</hi> And the <hi>infinite love</hi> of the <hi>third Perſon,</hi> the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> the <hi>applyer</hi> of <hi>Redemption.</hi> Some moſt <hi>ſerious Meditation</hi> of God, and <hi>glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> him, to <hi>give down</hi> into the heart a <hi>glowing heat</hi> and <hi>livelineſs,</hi> for all the <hi>following day,</hi> is ſtill fit in ſome meaſure to be practiſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next ſhould be ſome ſerious muſing on that <hi>next End, our own ſalvation</hi> and <hi>Eternal bappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:47560:63"/>farther to be <hi>wrought out,</hi> to be our <hi>day labour,</hi> by the opportunity of a new begun day, a day, which will bring us nearer to the <hi>Ocean</hi> of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the next End, Salvation.</head>
               <p>NExt to the higheſt Gods intereſt, muſt be muſed ſeriouſly upon this <hi>great ſoul-intereſt; Prov.</hi> 9.12. <hi>If thou art wiſe, thou art wiſe for thy ſelf.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Wiſdom to ſalvation.</hi> This, becauſe ſelf is ſo <hi>near</hi> and <hi>dear,</hi> and the immortal Soul ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably precious, the heart being <hi>once ſtampt with a ſpiritual high ſtrong ſelf-love,</hi> will have a mighty influence of warmth abiding on the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Here two things are to be attended and practiſed. 1. Meditation of <hi>Salvation</hi> in a <hi>more general Notion</hi> and <hi>Conſideration,</hi> works little or nothing, but the <hi>pondering of particulars</hi> in Salvation: It is a <hi>Rule in Oratory,</hi> and ſo <hi>in Preaching,</hi> that for moving and drawing the affections, generals and <hi>things in a confuſed manner ſpoken, they hit not, work not, draw not.</hi> It is the diſtinct ſeeing and viewing of particulars which moves and affects to purpoſe: So Meditation to be effectual <hi>muſt particularize</hi> the things compriſed, in ſome ſort, in this happineſs and ſalvation: As that ſo <hi>bleſſed freedom from ſin</hi> in the guilt, in pardon, and righteouſneſs, <hi>from the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of ſin, by power, life, image of Chriſt, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and the <hi>glorious priviledges</hi> of a Chriſtian
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47560:64"/>here, and <hi>Everlaſting Glory</hi> hereafter; and ſuch like.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There's <hi>another Rule among Oratours,</hi> that things moving the Affections, they do it either <hi>Magnitudine aut Praeſentia,</hi> by their <hi>greatneſs</hi> or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,</hi> or by their <hi>preſence</hi> or <hi>nearneſs:</hi> As the greatneſs of a perſon, or the preſence of a perſon; or the greatneſs of a <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil,</hi> or the nearneſs and preſence of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>greatneſs,</hi> the ſurpaſſing <hi>greatneſs</hi> of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as Scripture ſets it forth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. That ſo <hi>unſpeakable deliverance</hi> from ſuch a <hi>height, breadth,</hi> and <hi>length</hi> of Miſery by ſin; and that <hi>inexpreſſible happineſs</hi> by <hi>union with Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>ſo great things</hi> of this <hi>glorious ſtate,</hi> ſhould fall by our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation upon the Affections, and daily, like <hi>fire from Heaven,</hi> kindle them greatly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Things move by their <hi>preſence</hi> or <hi>nearneſs:</hi> the <hi>remoter</hi> the Object is from the <hi>Faculty,</hi> as the <hi>Objects</hi> of the <hi>External Senſes,</hi> as Seeing, Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the reſt; or the farther a thing is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended to be, as any <hi>Place,</hi> or <hi>Time,</hi> or the like, the leſs it <hi>affects:</hi> But the <hi>preſence</hi> or <hi>propinquity</hi> of a thing <hi>moves moſt,</hi> as when a <hi>Poyſon</hi> or <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> thing is near or preſent, as an Antidote or a help when near, when <hi>Death</hi> or <hi>Deliverance</hi> is at hand, when a <hi>Friend</hi> is preſent, or the like, this moves moſt. So the way of Meditation here, is by <hi>repreſenting ſalvation</hi> as <hi>preſent</hi> or <hi>near,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3. eſcaping Hell <hi>as now,</hi> being put into poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Heaven <hi>as now;</hi> if I were <hi>now</hi> dying, and my Soul ſitting on my lips, ready to take its flight <hi>as now;</hi> if <hi>now</hi> the <hi>laſt Trump</hi> were ſounding; <hi>now</hi> Jeſus Chriſt ſeen <hi>coming</hi> to Judgment; <hi>now</hi> the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47560:64"/>of Abſolution paſſing: Let me thus <hi>ſeaſon</hi> and <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> Meditation by this kind of <hi>repreſentation,</hi> ſeeing it <hi>as near, as preſent, now acting, now doing,</hi> or <hi>now having,</hi> and fully <hi>poſſeſſing</hi> this Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>THE next thing in <hi>ſpiritual wiſdom, to be the Object</hi> of daily Meditation, is to give (as we can) ſome allowance of ſerious thoughts, of that which ſhould be the due and <hi>adequate means,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to the chief End, of Eternal life, with the <hi>glorifying of God,</hi> as formerly we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt the way.</hi> Therefore the next thing (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the higheſt and uppermoſt of all conducing Means to the Supream End) the next thing I ſay, to be the great Object of Meditation, <hi>muſt be Jeſus Chriſt, our way to the Father, and our higheſt way</hi> of glorifying him: <hi>None comes to the Father,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>but by me, John—</hi> Initial coming to God by Faith to Juſtification, Reconciliation and Union with God is by Chriſt: All other after comings, and glorifyings of God, are ſtill by Chriſt, as alſo all ſalvation is treaſured up in him: ſo it muſt be the beſt way for our Meditations method, to be daily acted in ſome meaſure upon our mighty Saviour, our great and only way to our great and chief End, ſo he calls himſelf <hi>the way, John—</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:47560:65"/>
               <p>Here what a moſt <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>delicious</hi> Object hath the Eye of Meditation?</p>
               <p>Chriſt, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.1. calls, <hi>Behold me, behold me;</hi> ah what a Spirit muſt that be, that for ſuch an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Beauty cannot afford <hi>one caſt of the eye, one wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look</hi> in the whole compaſs of a day; that can look every way freely, fixedly, and unweariedly, but <hi>Chriſtward?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> her <hi>Eye-walk</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Excellencies and Beauties of her Beloved the Lord Chriſt, his pure <hi>Colours,</hi> White and Red, his moſt <hi>rare features</hi> and <hi>exact proportions</hi> of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part, his <hi>Head, Locks, Eyes, Cheeks, Lips, Hands, Legs, and all his glorious perfections,</hi> and then addes to fum up all, that he is <hi>altogether lovely:</hi> So lovely that her Eye <hi>affected her heart,</hi> and ſo beloved that <hi>ſhe fell ſick of love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ah when a heart is <hi>ſtrongly enflamed</hi> with a Love to Chriſt, the eye will be acted in moſt <hi>wiſhly look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon Chriſt;</hi> as the love grows, the earneſt look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings will grow.</p>
               <p>Here then the Rule is, to Meditate in ſome due meaſure on this <hi>Glorious Object,</hi> ſo both <hi>infinitely excellent</hi> in himſelf, and ſo mighty a <hi>Saviour unto us.</hi> His <hi>infinite</hi> Riches and Preciouſneſs, in his <hi>Natures united,</hi> in his <hi>Offices conferred,</hi> in his <hi>graces fullneſs,</hi> perfect performances, moſt perfect Redemption, his infinite love, pity, willingneſs to ſave loſt Sinners: The ſo great <hi>free offers of himſelf,</hi> and <hi>giving himſelf</hi> to us, <hi>applying</hi> his whole Redemption to us, by his <hi>mighty operation</hi> in us: Some <hi>ſingular ſeriouſneſs</hi> and <hi>rigour</hi> of Meditation cannot but daily be due, as that <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>chief means</hi> to the chief End.

SOme due proportion of <hi>Thoughts-ſeriouſneſs</hi> is proper to be daily acted, in reference to the <hi>mighty,</hi> and <hi>only applyer</hi> of the work of Chriſts Redemption, <hi>the holy Spirit,</hi> and <hi>our great daily helper.</hi> The Holy Spirit firſt comes to the Soul and perſon of a Chriſtian, <hi>applies</hi> Chriſt to him, brings <hi>Chriſt</hi> into him, makes him his Temple, and an Habitation of God and Chriſt to dwell in the heart: The Spirit comes, inhabits, ſweeps and cleanſes; furniſhes the heart with <hi>light,</hi> that was <hi>darkneſs;</hi> with <hi>truth,</hi> that was <hi>errour</hi> and <hi>deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs;</hi> with <hi>power,</hi> that was <hi>weakneſs; life-warmth</hi> and qualifications of heavenly Graces, that was <hi>cold, dead,</hi> and altogether <hi>ſinful,</hi> and draws the glorious image of Chriſt upon the Soul: He enlivens, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes, enlarges, and encourages, and fills the Spirit with peace and joy unſpeakable. We act from his <hi>blowings on the Gardens of our hearts, then the ſpices of Graces flow. Cant.</hi> 4.16.</p>
               <p>The Wheels, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 10.17. <hi>moved from the ſpirit in them;</hi> ſo a Chriſtian moves or not, as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit moves or not. Every day, and for every Duty in the day, there is need of a new blowing of the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47560:66"/>Spirit, that the Spices may flow: new moving, that the Wheels may move us.</p>
               <p>We muſt neither grieve, quench, or reſiſt the Holy Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51. The Spirit who is our Helper and Applyer farther of Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of his fulneſs.</p>
               <p>If we will act wiſely, the Eye of the Soul by Meditation muſt <hi>daily be pondering</hi> the neceſſity of the Holy Spirits Influences, ſtirrings up, ſtrengthenings, and enlargements: when we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and ſlight the Spirit, and <hi>ſo want juſtly his help,</hi> we muſt needs drive on heavily: But when <hi>we mind him</hi> and have his aſſiſtance, this <hi>wings</hi> the Soul and makes it to move <hi>ſtrongly</hi> and <hi>nimbly</hi> to the main mark.</p>
               <p>If the Queſtion were askt, what were the <hi>higheſt thoughts</hi> the mind can poſſibly think, they would be ſuch as theſe three following.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That thought of the <hi>ſo infinite</hi> and <hi>all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired love</hi> of God the Father, in giving freely his Son for Sinners.</item>
                  <item>2. That thought of that <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>all amazing love</hi> of God the Son, in giving ſo freely himſelf for his Fathers Enemies.</item>
                  <item>3. That thought of God the Holy Spirit's <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love,</hi> aſtoniſhing love, in ſo freely giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into ſuch <hi>dunghill helliſh hearts,</hi> to make them his <hi>glorious Habitation,</hi> his <hi>Palace</hi> and <hi>Solace,</hi> to be the <hi>mighty heart-helper</hi> and <hi>Comforter.</hi> This Spirit then muſt not be grieved by the leaſt neglect, but highly and conſtantly both honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and cheriſhed, with our utmoſt thought-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs and earneſtneſs, that ſo thinkings may work up to <hi>livelieſt</hi> lookings for him, lookings
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47560:66"/>to <hi>liſtenings</hi> for his knockings at the door of our Hearts, liſtenings for ready <hi>lettings</hi> of him in; and being let in we may give him the <hi>higheſt</hi> and <hi>freeſt Entertainments,</hi> with <hi>yieldings</hi> of the fulleſt obedience unto him.</item>
               </list>
               <p>It is reported, that formerly, ſometimes Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers Sailing by the Coaſts of <hi>Arabia the happy,</hi> have had by the Winds blowing off the Land, ſuch rare rich ſmells, and <hi>perfumes</hi> of the <hi>precious ſpices,</hi> that (without the Experience of it) it is hardly cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible. Sometimes the Holy Spirit ſo blows on the Garden of a Chriſtians heart, that the Spices in ſuch ſort perfume it, with Raviſhments of Peace and Joy, that are inexpreſſible, and then it runs apace to the main mark.</p>
               <p>Ah then it muſt be beſt to enter on the work of the day, by an <hi>early</hi> and <hi>earneſt</hi> eying of this <hi>glorious Helper,</hi> the Holy Spirit, who is ſooner <hi>ready</hi> to lend us his helping hand, then we are <hi>ready</hi> for it.</p>

               <p n="3">3. THE Ordinances of Chriſt are the next ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral things Meditation may fix on: The Ordinances are <hi>our ways of communion with God,</hi> the ways whereby God conveighs himſelf to us, the King of Heavens <hi>high-ways of ſpiritual Commerce</hi> and <hi>Trade.</hi> The <hi>Roads</hi> and <hi>Paths</hi> wherein the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit <hi>walks,</hi> and <hi>comes</hi> to apply himſelf to us; and <hi>our ways</hi> in which we are to go forth and meet him, <hi>apply our ſelves</hi> to him, <hi>fix an heavenly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi> and acquaintance with him.</p>
               <p>The Winds blow from all the <hi>Quarters</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the Holy Spirit breaths and blows from all his <hi>heavenly Ordinances:</hi> We may therein look for the breathings of the Spirit, but we muſt not look for the Holy Spirit <hi>out of his own ways.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prerogative of the Spirit is, not to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely <hi>tied</hi> to Ordinances; but our <hi>liberty,</hi> is not to be <hi>looſed</hi> from them: We are tied to the ways of Chriſt, which are our warrantable ways for commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and waiting his Spirits comings and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>The Eye of Meditation ſhould act daily in ſuch freſh and vigorous lookings on the Ordinances, as may more <hi>highly commeid</hi> them, <hi>raiſe</hi> their price, <hi>repreſent</hi> them more lovely, <hi>reduce</hi> us to more even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in performance, by finding them more <hi>eaſie</hi> and <hi>ſweet</hi> in continued <hi>uſe,</hi> and <hi>exerciſing</hi> our ſelves in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47560:67"/>them; and <hi>induce</hi> ſtill higher <hi>admirations,</hi> by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riencing their help and efficacies. The Ordinances of Chriſt have their <hi>high ratification</hi> in the Holy Scriptures for their power and efficacy. The Saints in all Ages, have given their <hi>great confirmation,</hi> ſet their <hi>probatum eſt</hi> to every of them, by millions of encouraging <hi>experiences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When that Ordinances are more precious, they are the more efficacious:</hi> O let our Meditations daily ſcope be, to make them more <hi>precious,</hi> that they may prove more <hi>efficacious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Like that eminent pattern, that great Meditater <hi>David;</hi> that <hi>high progreſs</hi> he made in Meditating of the ways of God, ſet the Price higher, made his heart warmer.</p>
               <p>He Meditated and he <hi>valued</hi> more, <hi>admired</hi> more, and he <hi>acted</hi> more eminently, and <hi>arrived</hi> at laſt at that pitch, which hath left him on Record in the <hi>higheſt rank of Saints that ever lived.</hi> The Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances therefore are moſt worthy our daily muſing on, as for their own <hi>excellency,</hi> as the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens high Inſtitutions; ſo, <hi>as the Holy Spirits walks,</hi> wherein he comes to meet us, and have communion with us, and apply <hi>Chriſt</hi> more unto us.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of Meditation on the Word of God, and the Promiſes, whereby the Spirit firſt is given, and after works.</head>
               <p>THE Word of God is that <hi>ſure wiſdom</hi> reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us by God, to lead us by his Counſel to Glory: That <hi>only infallible Rule</hi> given us to walk by: It is the <hi>Golden Scepter of Chriſt,</hi> for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his Kingdom to come and touch the top of: The dear purchaſe of Jeſus Chriſt for the only Rule of his Redeemed; the breathing and dictate of the Holy Spirit; the high product, and that cleareſt ſhining forth of the brighteſt beams of Infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Truth, Holineſs, Righteouſneſs, Mercy, Free-Grace, Love, Power, and all Glories and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Author, for the bleſſed Ends it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed.</p>
               <p>It is the excellent Inſtrument in the hand of the Spirit, whereby he effects his great Soul-ſaving work; whereby he brings about that work of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the applying of loſt ſinners to an All-ſufficient Saviour firſt, by effectual calling, and then applies Chriſt more and more, building them up more in him unto perfection. If I look for the Spirits ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, I muſt look for, and apply my ſelf to the help of that rare Tool and Inſtrument he ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates by. Think what an Engine it is, what moſt admired glorious work he hath effected by it; upon millions of blind Eyes, hard Hearts, Perſons impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47560:68"/>Crippled in their Souls, Dead in ſins and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſſes, at the dreadful diſtance from God, of Haters and Enemies of him, and all things leading to him; enlightening them, healing them, and reconciling them to himſelf, and his Word and Ways.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of Meditation of the Spirits drawing to Chriſt by the Promiſes.</head>
               <p>AS it is the Inſtrument in the Spirits hand, and without which it would do nothing, could not awaken, humble, and convert the Soul; ſo it cannot either convert and bring in, or confirm and build up without that moſt ſignal ſweeteſt part, the precious Promiſes; and the Promiſes would do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of the hand of the Holy Spirit, and his efficacious managing of them.</p>
               <p>The Grounds and Encouragements of all our drawings near to God through Chriſt by his Spirit in his Ordinances, are the Promiſes of the Goſpel, and the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>Sinners muſt not draw nigh to God, without his Warrant and Command firſt given.</p>
               <p>But a Command will not be yielded to, unleſs there be the encouragement of a promiſe of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and help, in both the firſt, and all other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter approches to God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.49. <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.9. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. <hi>Num.</hi> 14.18.</p>
               <p>And the Promiſes muſt be managed and ordered by the Holy Spirit, elſe they will have no vigour
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47560:69"/>or efficacy, as to either initial application of Chriſt, or to any farther and fuller application of him. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. The Spirit is called the <hi>Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> as given by the Word of Promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Received ye the Spirit by the, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.38. The Goſpel (that is by the Promiſes of it) is call'd <hi>the Miniſtration of the Spirit;</hi> which is not only of the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit, but the ſaving ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of it, from its inhabitation.</p>
               <p>It is called the Spirit of Promiſe, as conveying and working all to us and in us by the Promiſe: Chriſt and his Grace is not offered by God, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by a Chriſtian, by any man (I mean grown up perſon) but by the offer of him in a Promiſe: there is no immediate acting upon Chriſt, for a firſt, or after and fuller receiving of him, but by the <hi>medium,</hi> the way of an intervening Promiſe. God holds forth, and Faith ſees it, and takes Chriſt offer'd in the Promiſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. <hi>To him give all the, &amp;c.</hi> As the Spirits humbling, is by his whetting, and ſetting home by his art, the threatnings of wrath and death Eternal, ſo the comforts of the Spiritare by his ſetting home the promiſes of ſalvation: And further ſupplies of Grace are by the promiſes through the co-operating of the Holy Spirit, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to receive farther of Chriſt his fulneſs by the promiſes, that are <hi>Yea and Amen in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. But all this farther operation of the Spirit, and receiving more of the Grace of Chriſt, it is by Meditation and pondering of the <hi>Promiſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Freſh receivings from Chriſt muſt be founded in freſh Meditation of the <hi>Promiſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The more intenſe and earneſt the ponderings of the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of growth and encreaſe are, the larger
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:47560:69"/>will your deſires, the more earneſt your endeavours be after more of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians are ſometimes in <hi>great haſte to believe ſtrongly, but cannot reach it, becauſe they meditate on the Promiſes ſlenderly.</hi> They make <hi>the beſt work</hi> of it, who dwell and act moſt upon the promiſes, that ſtill Meditate <hi>from promiſe to promiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the Promiſes, we are made partakers of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cleanſe our ſelves from all pollution of Fleſh and Spirit, perfect holineſs in the fear of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.</p>
               <p>There be great varieties of precious promiſes for Juſtification, Sanctification, and the reſt. There is a tranſcendent Truth, Goodneſs, and Freeneſs in the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> great and rich ſupplies made over to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers by them: But they will not <hi>give down</hi> their Milk, without our <hi>due mindings</hi> and <hi>daily Meditat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> on them: Meditation muſt <hi>preſs out</hi> the Juice and ſweetneſs, <hi>gather the rare Honey</hi> that is upon theſe <hi>Flowers of precious Promiſes.</hi> If Bones be <hi>full of Marrow,</hi> it muſt be gotten out by <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>knocking:</hi> The <hi>Promiſes</hi> ſo full of <hi>marrow</hi> and <hi>ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> muſt yield it forth by Meditation. Lay <hi>ſound weight</hi> of Meditation on them, to <hi>preſs</hi> out the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and virtue in them.</p>
               <p>If therefore a Chriſtian would daily have his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Chriſt, if he daily would <hi>touch Chriſt,</hi> ſo as to have virtue go out of him, for healing and help in any kind; bring your Eye to the hand of the Spirit, and to the Promiſe, which <hi>he</hi> muſt be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to work your coming to Chriſt by, and freſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivings of Grace from. <hi>Meditate well, that you may ſpeed well:</hi> Let the <hi>promiſes mellow in thy heart</hi> by Meditation, that thou mayſt find how ſweet they this way are.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And in that all my converſation in the Day muſt be <hi>holy and heavenly, comfortable and fruitful,</hi> I muſt meditate of ſtirring up <hi>the grace given me,</hi> to act by the help of the Spirit, <hi>upon Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>to him,</hi> for <hi>working out my own ſalvation,</hi> and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of God thereby.</p>

               <p>Without the exerciſing of theſe <hi>Graces</hi> all the converſation is carnal, not ſpiritual, all Duties are but <hi>dead carcaſses,</hi> and <hi>loathſom to God.</hi> I muſt think

The Armour of God I muſt put on for every part, and my fighting in the ſtrength of Chriſt, by whom <hi>I may be made more than Conquerour, Rom.</hi> 8.37.</p>
               <p>And for the laſt general, there muſt be Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>unſpeakable preciouſneſs of time,</hi> running on without poſſibility of a ſtand, or leaſt ſtay: With the <hi>Frailty of life, Pſal.</hi> 39.4. with the <hi>uncertainty</hi> of it, and the <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>death,</hi> and unavoidable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that which will caſt me upon <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the more general things, among which my Meditation may take <hi>its walks,</hi> and upon which my ſeriouſneſs may daily ſit down to make its ſpiritual advantage by: I muſt adde now things more particular.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of ſome Particulars to be added to the former Generals.</head>
               <p>THere are ſome things in particular I may adde, which may help to direct and quicken a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in his daily courſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Scripture I daily read, or hear, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour ſome thoughts which may help to <hi>higher quickenings,</hi> and <hi>heart-enlargings,</hi> by farther <hi>freſh ponderings</hi> of the <hi>ſurpaſſing Excellencies</hi> and mighty <hi>Efficacies</hi> of the Scripture; to think of a required <hi>higher riſing eſtimation,</hi> more <hi>inflamed affections</hi> of Love, Joy, Hope, Longing, and the reſt, ſeen and ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervably conſpicuous in the Saints in Scripture; to light our Candle by their flame: And the more <hi>rooted reſolution</hi> I ſhould take up and engage in, to be more (by my looking into the Glaſs of the Word) <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into the image of it,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of Faith in the Word.</hi> I ſhould farther think of that Faith I am neceſſarily to act, in the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>certainty,</hi> and <hi>uſefulneſs of the Word,</hi> I now am to be exerciſed in; and of my mixing of Faith more abundantly with it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. As to any Doctrine, Precept, Promiſe, Threatning, or Examples, and whatever is there related for my uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of Wiſdom.</hi> I ſhould think alſo of the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> which that I read requires, in ſelecting that out is moſt conducible, is my proper portion, and beſt fitting my ſouls condition. As <hi>Samuel</hi> at his Feaſt,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:47560:72"/>ſet forth ſomething peculiar for <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.23, 24. <hi>Joſeph</hi> cauſed to be prepared for his Brother <hi>Benjamin, Gen.</hi> 43.34. God will now be ſeen, if wiſdom be uſed to hold forth a peculiar prepared portion. Some <hi>Eye-ſalve</hi> to annoint mine Eyes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. ſome <hi>rich Balm</hi> to heal ſome ſore, ſome <hi>corroſive</hi> to eat out ſome proud fleſh, ſome <hi>Cordial</hi> for a ſtrengthener and chearer, ſome piece of <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual treaſure</hi> to enrich me, ſome <hi>rare Jewel</hi> for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament wanting to me; ſomething there is now in my hand, for my now <hi>ſpiritual advantage,</hi> if I can ſee it; and ſee it I may, by that which muſt be the <hi>Auxiliary</hi> and conſtant <hi>Aſſiſtant</hi> of my reading, if I would meet with a due profiting, which is my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious and careful pondering, weighing, and weighing this pure Gold, ſtored up in Chriſts rich Treaſury to make me rich.</p>
               <p>Reading brings me Meat, Meditation brings forth the ſweetneſs.</p>
               <p>Reading brings the Coals to the Wood, Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes the flame.</p>
               <p>Reading brings me the Sword of the Word, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation whets it.</p>
               <p>Reading barely, proves pouring water into a <hi>Sieve;</hi> Meditation is putting Gold into a Treaſury, the former lets the Water out, the latter locks the Gold up.</p>
               <p>O let me read much, but let me alſo Meditate much, that Meditation and Reading may be <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate;</hi> my Souls <hi>digeſtion</hi> proportioned to its <hi>Reception,</hi> its taking in by Reading; let me Read and Meditate, that I may not have a <hi>meagre, lean ſoul,</hi> like them that have an <hi>eager</hi> appetite, and a <hi>weak digeſtion;</hi> but that it may be fat and well-liking,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47560:73"/>by this good digeſtion of due Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some lively and vigorous Meditation ſhould be daily performed, in <hi>reference</hi> to private Prayer; I ſay for aſſiſtance and furtherance of ſecret <hi>Cloſet-Prayer,</hi> that ſo <hi>important</hi> and ſweet Soul-Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Of that <hi>importancy</hi> and concernment, that the <hi>main ſtreſs</hi> both of the whole work, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the hearts after warmth and life in the day, lies greatly on it.</item>
                  <item>2. Of that heavenly ſweetneſs, that it is the chief way of our <hi>private</hi> familiarity with God.</item>
                  <item>3. Of that <hi>excellency,</hi> that it is our only way of <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſpeaking</hi> unto the great God, of having the high honour and favour of <hi>whiſpering in his ear,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in private to his <hi>boſom and bowels,</hi> and the <hi>chief way</hi> of procuring his private <hi>Signet</hi> and <hi>Seal</hi> of bleſſed aſſurance of happineſs. The way it is of the ſouls freſheſt, freeſt, and moſt elevated actings; ſuch as oft-times praying in company muſt not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear, and the way of ſtrong <hi>high Exerciſe</hi> of ſundry Graces.</item>
               </list>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It ſends <hi>private Embaſſies</hi> daily to the King of Heaven by Faith.</item>
                  <item>2. It carries up daily the ſoul to Heaven in a <hi>Chariot of fire</hi> by love; and</item>
                  <item>3. It leaves continually an <hi>Agent</hi> in the Court of Heaven by Hope.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Its the great <hi>heart-warmer</hi> by privacy, giving the greater advantage of <hi>importunity,</hi> without any check from the preſence of others.</p>
               <p>The great heart-humbler, <hi>Melter down</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finer,</hi> inſtrumentally, by actings of ſound and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47560:73"/>kindly <hi>Repentance:</hi> Making the droſs and embaſing mixtures of Corruptions and Luſts to paſs away, and the heart become purer.</p>
               <p>Its the peculiar <hi>advantage</hi> to learn and act the rare art and ſecret of wreſtling with God, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the high encouragements of <hi>holy over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comings</hi> of him.</p>
               <p>It is the way of the <hi>rareſt hours, higheſt</hi> ſoul-Raptures, <hi>richeſt</hi> pourings in of comforts, and moſt <hi>happy experiencings</hi> of the deſcendings down of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in pureſt, ſweeteſt, largeſt <hi>ſoul-ſatieties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore for <hi>richeſt</hi> furniſhing us with fitteſt matter for a beſt heart frame to perform this daily duty, performing it in the moſt ſpiritual and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual manner, for doing it, as to <hi>out-do</hi> former, all former doings, we muſt look to lay the Foundation <hi>deeper and larger</hi> in better and more ſuited Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Meditatings, <hi>think to the utmoſt, to pray to the beſt.</hi> The ſame word in the Hebrew ſignifies, as divers of the Learned ſay, both Meditation and Prayer. Firſt it ſignifies Meditation, and then by a Metonymy of the Cauſe for the Effect, it ſignifies Prayer. To ſhew what Prayers ſhould be ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the great God, ſuch as have ſome due <hi>weight of Meditation,</hi> which are <hi>made out</hi> and <hi>made up</hi> of Meditation, or have at leaſt the beſt ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we can. That <hi>great</hi> man of <hi>Prayer,</hi> the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt <hi>David,</hi> ordinarily calls his <hi>Prayer</hi> his <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and peculiarly his <hi>Prayer</hi> in the morning (the foundation of the following days work) <hi>his Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Pſal.</hi> 5.1, 2. in that excellent and warm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that <hi>Pſalm:</hi> Prayer and Meditation, like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> Twins, born, lived, and died toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo <hi>Meditation</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> riſe, and warm, and

               </p>
               <p>O let my Spirit be ſtill warmed, inflamed, and melted down in Meditation, that it may run and flow and flame in this <hi>heavenly devotion,</hi> and both iſſue in my daily wiſer and warmer working out ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. My ſerious and curious Mindings muſt make ſure to ſingle out, and ſet in full view <hi>that</hi> or <hi>thoſe</hi> things I <hi>particularly want,</hi> and are moſt proper and neceſſary for the <hi>now, for my ſouls preſent ſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no godly man, but hath ever ſomething which concerns him moſt.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>corruption ſtirring</hi> that muſt be ſubdued, ſome <hi>Temptation</hi> to be encountred, ſome <hi>Grace</hi> to be endeavoured, ſome <hi>comfort</hi> or <hi>help</hi> ſupplyed.</p>
               <p>It may be many things may be the preſent, if not <hi>urgent</hi> concerns.</p>

               <p>IN the next place let me <hi>Meditate</hi> of what I want as to <hi>ſelf-denial and Mortification,</hi> evidenced by the weeds of corruptions coming up in my ſpirit, <hi>Mar.</hi> 8.34. or ready ever and anon to ariſe and get ground, and all ſtill upon that <hi>grand intereſt</hi> of ſelf, or the Reliques of the <hi>Roots</hi> or <hi>Stumps</hi> of it: This which hath not been ſpoken to, this ſelf-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, the taking of it <hi>down</hi> in my heart, is one of the <hi>greateſt concernments</hi> Meditation daily ſhould fix upon: Self is the <hi>great Hinge</hi> the carnal heart hangs and turns upon: There the <hi>Center</hi> is ſelf, the <hi>Circumference</hi> ſelf, all the <hi>lines</hi> are drawn from ſelf and to ſelf.</p>
               <p>Self is the <hi>great Rival</hi> and <hi>Competitioner</hi> with the infinitely ſurpaſſing God, and contends for ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with him, yea ſelf <hi>ſits</hi> in the Throne, <hi>wears the Crown, holds the Scepter,</hi> and ſelf is the ſinners <hi>all in all.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. All <hi>poſitive actings</hi> in <hi>ſenſualities, pride,</hi> and <hi>covetouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>other evils</hi> are but to ſatisfie ſelf.</item>
                  <item>2. All <hi>negative</hi> ways and omittings of good, are but to <hi>gratifie ſelf,</hi> to <hi>eaſe ſlothful ſelf,</hi> loth to be put to ſtir, leaſt willing to labour, toil, or ſtrive, leaſt of all to loſe, ſmart, and ſuffer.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Self <hi>claps the great ſtrong Biaſs</hi> on the ſoul, is the ſpreading <hi>prevailing poyſon</hi> in it, and empoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons it all over.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:47560:75"/>
               <p>Self is higheſt in the <hi>eſtimation,</hi> nothing paſſes at ſo high a rate, not God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Self is <hi>higheſt in the affection,</hi> nothing ſo near as ſelf.</p>
               <p>Self is <hi>higheſt in the purpoſe</hi> and <hi>intention,</hi> nothing ſo aimed at as ſelf.</p>
               <p>Self <hi>in the converſation,</hi> it hath the endeavours, earneſtneſs, and equality: It is like the moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſeiſing, deep rooting, and ſpreading poyſon, of greateſt virulency and prevalency: Thus it is in a natural heart. In a holy heart, though the <hi>moſt high God,</hi> by the power of Grace, be now higheſt, really chief, yet that remaining part of ſelf, the pieces left behind, oft as it were do <hi>juſtle him,</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently juſtle him, to get his place and ſit uppermoſt, for what do ſins, when our minds, wiſdom, deſires, and wills, and our ways, when they thwart and croſs his mind, wiſdom, will, and ways, but as it were <hi>juſtle</hi> him, and ſtrive to be uppermoſt?</p>
               <p>Hereby ſelf ſometimes (out of careleſneſs) ſelf it ſeems to have regained the Throne, and repoſſeſt it ſelf of the ſoveraignty loſt.</p>
               <p>In the beſt heart there is ſo much of this bitter Root ſpringing out, ſo much of this <hi>ſoul-bane,</hi> ſo much of this <hi>Touch-wood, Tinder, Powder</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently take, and inſtantly blow up, ſo much of this <hi>Idol,</hi> this <hi>Dagon</hi> ſet ſo near the Ark, that it hath need of the greateſt daily mindings and ponderings, as the greateſt Enemy that hath gained the greateſt advantage of us, it lies ſtill in our <hi>Boſoms:</hi> Its like the <hi>worm</hi> that breeds and feeds of the Bodies own fleſh: This of all others is the <hi>greateſt Idol;</hi> I ſay, ſelf is the greateſt Idol that ever was or will be. There's no <hi>Image of Jealouſie</hi> like it in the Eye of a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47560:75"/>God, therefore no one thing requires a more daily minding, for a daily watchfulneſs; Mindings for the <hi>effectual help</hi> and relief againſt all <hi>particular luſts,</hi> which are but the leſſer Branches of the great Root of ſelf, the <hi>Scouts</hi> and <hi>Forragers</hi> ſent forth from the <hi>Head-quarter</hi> of ſelf.</p>
               <p>This ſelf it is that is the great <hi>correſpondent</hi> and <hi>confederate</hi> with Satan; if ſelf were not the ground within, of his attempts from without, he could do nothing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mathematician</hi> boaſtingly ſaid, tell me but where I may place my Engine, and I will ſhake the Earth. Satan knowing where to place his Engine, knows how to ſhake us and worſt us, if we watch him not, and this ſelf.</p>
               <p>I muſt mind it moſt, and truſt it leaſt; labour the <hi>moſt peremptory</hi> and <hi>conſtant denyings</hi> of it, and as my higheſt wiſdom, to mortifie particular Luſts that are all fed from this <hi>great Root,</hi> and likewiſe to keep off Satan from this <hi>advantage ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have it may be enlarged too far upon this: very brief I ſhall be on thoſe that remain.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of ſome other particulars which may be ſometimes Meditated upon in the day.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſin.</hi> IT will be my wiſdom to conſider <hi>that ſin or corruption</hi> which troubles me moſt, which out of this ſpring of ſelf and ſinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is more apt to <hi>owſe</hi> out of my heart, and make <hi>a breach</hi> in the Banks that Chriſt by his grace hath made there. That particular evil which is ſo ſtrong, ſtirring, and ſtriving, to carry me down the ſtream and keep me under: <hi>I was upright,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23. <hi>before him, and kept my ſelf from mine iniquity;</hi> that ſin which had been of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar prevalence, and would be ſo again; the ſin that had ſpecial edge and eagerneſs, too oft appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and endeavouring it, attempting to make its eſcape from his watch, his heart-keeping, and appear in act and power.</p>
               <p>There is ſome corruption or evil in every ſpirit, which like ſome <hi>rank weed</hi> in the Garden is ſtill putting up, or ready to put forth, like ſome <hi>leak in a Veſſel,</hi> ready to run out by it.</p>
               <p>This needs a <hi>ſpecial minding</hi> and <hi>conſidering</hi> ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to its dangerouſneſs, as that which will be a <hi>thorn</hi> in the Foot, hinder our going, work diſquiet, daſh our confidence before God, and weaken our hands from our work.</p>
               <p>I muſt peculiarly conſider this daily, that it get not at any time ground of me, but that I gain upon it
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47560:76"/>more, that I <hi>watch</hi> it, <hi>fight</hi> it, look that this <hi>Gangreen</hi> ſpread not, <hi>run not up</hi> to my heart, but that I ſtop and kill it.</p>
               <p>Minding it duly will provoke to endeavour a right courſe, for the juſt cure and ſound healing of it.</p>
               <p>Meditation may be alſo of what other evils are <hi>buſie in my boſom,</hi> what are <hi>ſtirring moſt,</hi> what are <hi>getting any ground,</hi> and what are <hi>loſing it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What graces I want,</hi> or have moſt need of, to enable me more to lift up the Name of Chriſt, ſweeten my ſpirit with peace, eaſe my courſe, and render me more ſerviceable to others.</p>
               <p>Every day I ſhould <hi>well attend</hi> to what Goſpel Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments and Jewels I ought to put on and wear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others, to make my converſation ſhine, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> reports of <hi>Poppaea,</hi> the <hi>Wife of the Roman Emperour Nero,</hi> that when ſhe was to go abroad, ſhe ſtill would be deckt and adorn'd with ſuch <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi> and <hi>varieties</hi> of moſt precious Stones and Jewels, as it dazled the eyes of the Beholders.</p>
               <p>And I have read of a like manner, of the <hi>Mogul</hi> or <hi>great Emperour</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> who if on ſome ſpecial times he ſits out to be ſeen by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, he puts on ſuch great <hi>numbers</hi> of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, Carbuncles, Rubies,</hi> and other <hi>gliſtering</hi> and <hi>glorious Jewels,</hi> as they cannot without great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration behold him, yea can hardly, by reaſon of the Suns ſhining and <hi>reflections,</hi> diſcern his face, the <hi>glory</hi> of the Jewels is ſo great. Chriſtians muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their putting on, and wearing the <hi>rich Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>Jewels</hi> of <hi>heavenly graces,</hi> to ſhine glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in them, and take the Eyes of all that behold

               <p n="3">3. When holy <hi>David</hi> in his <hi>courſe of Meditation,</hi> after matters of his <hi>private concernment,</hi> cloſes ſo ordinarily the whole Meditation, with that <hi>grand intereſt of Zion,</hi> the Churches caſe; may not this be then a <hi>Rule to our Meditation,</hi> for a high demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of our <hi>publick ſpiritedneſs,</hi> our conſtant mindings of that <hi>ſuperlative</hi> and <hi>tranſcendent inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt</hi> of God in this world, the glory of his great Name in the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple given to him, their <hi>peace, proſperity,</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> and the diſappointments of all their Enemies De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, which alſo is <hi>an Article</hi> in their Heavenly Jointure?</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of the Sabbath, and Lords day.</head>
               <p>THere now remains but one thing more to be added to what hath been ſaid concerning dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meditation, namely, the Meditation relating to that <hi>eminent day of God,</hi> firſt the <hi>ſeventh day of the week,</hi> now in the New Teſtament times changed to, and <hi>called the firſt day</hi> of the week, and the Lords-day.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the riſe, nature, ends, and advantages the Sabbath in the Old Teſtament, and the Lords-day in the New, it is the <hi>beſt day</hi> that ever the world ſaw, or ſhall be ſeen on this ſide Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was and is that day wherein the <hi>infinite Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> and <hi>Excellencies</hi> of a God, have ſhined brighter and warmer on the ſpirits of men, than in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther days beſide; namely his infinite Wiſdom, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Love, Goodneſs, Mercy, and Riches of free Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Sabbath, <hi>as ſome judge,</hi> had its riſe ſo early as in Paradiſe, or when man was in ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; it muſt then be of very great Antiquity, and a <hi>rarity</hi> of <hi>great worth.</hi> And,</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then it muſt be that <hi>only holy day</hi> which man in ſtate of innocency had; and poſſibly, if he had ſtood, ſhould ever have had afterward.</p>
               <p n="5">5. After the firſt inſtitution it had the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and <hi>tremendous promulgation</hi> and <hi>ſanction,</hi> ſuch
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47560:79"/>a delivery and ratification, as no other Law (except thoſe that were ſpoken at the ſame time) ever had, namely, by Gods ſo wonderful and moſt aſtoniſhing appearance on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> in the ſight of ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand perſons: There it was one of the <hi>ten words</hi> ſpoken by Gods own mouth, by God firſt ſpoken in <hi>the ears</hi> of all that ſo prepared and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened numerous multitude, and after in the Mount was <hi>written with the finger of God,</hi> written on the <hi>firſt Table</hi> of Stone, before the ſix Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>ſecond Table.</hi> This Commandment thus written, was with the others <hi>reſerved in the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Ark</hi> or Cheſt, made purpoſely by <hi>Moſes</hi> from Gods Command to keep the Tables, and then by Gods Appointment <hi>was to be preſerved</hi> in the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tabernacle made by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and there it was to be with higheſt honour prefer'd to be kept in the <hi>Holy of Holies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Though ſome yield it not,</hi> yet others judge the Sabbath had its change, from the ſeventh to the firſt day of the week, by the Lord of the Sabbath, Chriſt himſelf, or at leaſt by his Apoſtles from his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p n="7">7. However it be changed, yet it is lookt upon as grounded on that <hi>ſo amazing part</hi> of our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, Chriſts ſo glorious Reſurrection on the third day after his Paſſion.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Sabbath formerly was the Old Teſtament Churches fixed time, to behold as in a mirrour the <hi>glory of God the Creator,</hi> his Eternal Godhead, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and moſt glorious Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, in the ſo admirable frame of Heaven and Earth, and the ſo various and curious pieces in it, all moſt exquiſitely wrought and finiſht.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:47560:79"/>
               <p>It was the peculiar time for ſetting up <hi>the Ladder</hi> of the Creatures by Contemplation to climb from Earth to Heaven with.</p>
               <p>But now changed into the firſt day of the week, it is the Chriſtian Churches time for beholding as in a mirrour, <hi>the glory more peculiarly of God the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer;</hi> now not in his Humiliation, but in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing and begun Exaltation in that his glorious Reſurrection from the dead, that his concerned peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might joy with higheſt and moſt heavenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, for this riſing of the Sun of Righteouſneſs, to be under the warmeſt and moſt vivifical beams of his infinite love.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Let me Meditate of this day, as the time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded for <hi>largeſt ſpiritual advantages,</hi> no day being ſo eminent for me and my Soul as this day.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Let me Meditate of this day as that happy ſeaſon, wherein the Ordinances of <hi>Chriſt do run in a fuller higher, and ſtronger current.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>More is offered me on this <hi>great ſoul-mart day</hi> than on other common Market-days, other week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day opportunities; it is the day whereby in ſome reſpects I have <hi>far better Ordinances,</hi> the Publick; in Communion with Chriſt, in the midſt, among thoſe that are <hi>gathered together</hi> in his Name.</p>
               <p>And then by the Publick <hi>I have better advantages for the Private,</hi> to perform them better. Private Duties having a better time and better helps, I muſt thereby be minded of my better performance.</p>
               <p n="11">11. It is the eminent day of <hi>meeting with God</hi> in his <hi>upper walks</hi> of more ſolemn Ordinances.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The day of days for our <hi>beſt ſpeaking</hi> with our God, and of <hi>higheſt familiarity</hi> with him.</p>
               <p n="13">13. It's the great time of our <hi>hearing</hi> from God,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47560:80"/>and having him moſt eminently to ſpeak to us: There be no hearings from God like this days hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, no ſuch voice, no ſuch efficacy can be expected as on this day.</p>
               <p n="14">14. It is the day wherein <hi>God ſits out,</hi> and is moſt to be ſeen; the great day of <hi>ſeeing Gods</hi> goings in the Sanctuary, ſeeing his Power and his Glory: No ſuch day for this as the Lords own day. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 63.2.</p>
               <p n="15">15. A day of <hi>feeding more on the Feaſt of fat things full of Marrow, Iſa.</hi> 25.6. <hi>Of being brought into the Kings Banquetting-Houſe, having the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Chriſts love ſpread more amply over us,</hi> than at other times, it being the day wherein the higheſt flamings up of his <hi>unſpeakable love appeared,</hi> in that he not only died, but roſe again from the dead, without which all his other labour and ſufferings had been loſt, and our ſouls been alſo loſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p n="16">16. It is a day <hi>dropt down from Heaven,</hi> may ſerve to give a <hi>taſte</hi> of the Sabbath and day kept there, and to ſet a Copy for us here to write after, in our holy reſtings and actings, attended with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly refreſhings.</p>
               <p>God that made all things, when he had finiſhed his work, he <hi>then reſted</hi> on the ſeventh day, and with <hi>his example</hi> of reſting, gave the <hi>precept</hi> of ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeventh day to the Church of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</p>
               <p>And <hi>the Lord of the Sabbath,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, reſting <hi>from his work,</hi> and riſing the firſt day of the week, <hi>gives the Example,</hi> and with the <hi>Example</hi> the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> of reſting and keeping holy the firſt day of the week to the Church of the New Teſtament, <hi>as ſome think,</hi> which therefore, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. <hi>they ſay</hi> is called
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47560:80"/>the Lords day, as the Ordinance of the Supper is called <hi>the Lords Supper,</hi> as inſtituted by him.</p>
               <p n="17">17. It is the day of <hi>reſting the body</hi> from labour, of <hi>reſpiteing the mind</hi> from worldly thoughts and cares, and of <hi>refreſhing the ſpirit</hi> with heavenly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, which rains down now on this day more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully; and with water of life that runs more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly in the pure Channels of holy Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Meditated on it ſhould be, as the ſeaſon of the beſt <hi>reciprocations,</hi> mutual actings between Earth and Heaven, wherein the ſoul hath the advantage of acting higher and more vigorouſly, to glorifie and pleaſe God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.5. and wherein God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the bleſſing more, and affords aſſiſtances more uſually than on any other days, as experiences prove.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Its a time to come from <hi>ſweeter</hi> and <hi>fuller</hi> communion with God in Chriſt (whoſe bleſſed day it is) to come with our faces ſhining and hearts flaming, <hi>made better</hi> to be on Earth, <hi>fitter to live</hi> in Heaven: And hereupon</p>
               <p n="20">20. To leave upon the ſpirit a more <hi>eager long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> fully to enjoy the <hi>Lord of the Sabbath,</hi> and have time turned wholly into Eternity.</p>
               <p>Theſe or ſuch like Meditations may be ſutable and quickening for improving the <hi>great opportunity</hi> of this day of Chriſt, and we cannot think too much, or too ſeriouſly for this great occaſion.</p>
               <p>Having in ſome meaſure thus endeavoured to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and illuſtrate this point of daily Meditation, both that which may be ſutable for the ſix days, and for the Lords day, I paſs to the next ſort, Occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Meditation.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of Occaſional Meditation, and that which is more extraordinary.</head>
               <p>SOlemn Occaſional Meditation comes now to be conſidered, which is the ſouls taking of time for, and acting Meditation on ſome particular ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected ſubject, either out of the Word of God, or among the Works of God, or ſomthing <hi>providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi> falling out, or ſomthing concerning our ſelves, any thing offering fit occaſion for fruitful Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>They may be chiefly referr'd to theſe two heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Either ſuch things as <hi>purpoſely</hi> we (out of <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties</hi> of ſubjects before us) do ſingle out for Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to help and quicken us in godlineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or ſome <hi>new freſh thing,</hi> which the hand of Gods Providence holdeth forth, for our particular obſerving and improving.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which we ourſelves, out of varieties of ſubjects, may or do ſingle out for our ſpiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>Here the <hi>ſcope</hi> and <hi>compaſs</hi> our Eye hath to make its choice of, and fix upon is very large: The Eye in Meditation hath before it the <hi>fulleſt, faireſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> can come in view: Here is a breadth, length, depth, height, a compaſs and circumference that in point of <hi>lawful liberty,</hi> you may look from Earth to Heaven, yea through the whole world, in all its vaſtneſs, and varieties of objects in it; and <hi>beyond</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:47560:81"/>them all, unto <hi>him</hi> that is ſo infinitely <hi>above</hi> them all, God himſelf, in all his ſo <hi>inconceivable</hi> exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and perfections.</p>
               <p>O how <hi>narrow</hi> then muſt that Spirit be, which ſhall be ſtraitned and <hi>at a loſs,</hi> for matter to employ and buſie its ſeriouſneſs about?</p>
               <p>That hath ſo large a Field to walk in, and ſo <hi>great varieties,</hi> as the vaſt world, Heaven and Earth, and all things in them; and the <hi>infinite God,</hi> with ſo many infinite excellencies as are in him, and yet to ſeek how to Meditate? Ah how barren, low, and poor muſt that ſpirit be which is enriched with ſo great proviſions for <hi>mind and thought entertainment,</hi> and for <hi>times improvement,</hi> and yet cannot fruitfully employ it ſelf, on ſome one thing or other that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelf to us, and <hi>invites</hi> our ſeeing and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of it.</p>
               <p>Although Meditation hath ſo great a <hi>latitude</hi> and liberty; a liberty to travel farther, and ſee more by far than all the great Travellers that have bin in the world: yet <hi>ſpiritual wiſdom</hi> teacheth us to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour</hi> the moſt advantageous way of engaging our <hi>thinking power</hi> in Meditation. For the wiſdom of this way we now are upon, it needs muſt lie <hi>in that manner and order,</hi> as moſt may conduce to the great and main end of glorifying God, and our own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. It is moſt true, that in point of <hi>liberty</hi> it is my Chriſtian priviledge to take and ſet before me <hi>any profitable ſubject</hi> to intend my thoughts upon, when no particular occaſion of Meditation doth otherwiſe oblige me: I ſay, when no particular <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary obligation</hi> is upon me, I may chuſe to meditate either on this or that uſeful ſubject as I pleaſe.</p>
               <p>I have the whole Creation for my <hi>Eye-walk,</hi> my
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:47560:82"/>Meditation, and ſpirits recreation: yea, and farther than the whole world extends; I may go to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template him that is the higheſt; if I pleaſe, like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and other Saints of God, I may with my Eye walk and look among the Works of God, the ſo excellent and unimitable pieces of his moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable framing: On all the ſo <hi>ſtately Fabrick</hi> of the world, any of the <hi>rare built ſtories</hi> lower or higher, any of the <hi>rich Furnitures</hi> or exquiſite things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it.</p>
               <p>Firſt I may view the <hi>lower ſtory</hi> wherein I am; fix upon the precious things the Earth hath <hi>within,</hi> the riches of Minerals and precious Metals, Silver, Gold, and the ſo uſeful other ſorts; the riches of all ſorts of precious Stones, Diamonds, Carbuncles, Rubies, Emeralds, and all the reſt.</p>
               <p>I may view the innumerable exquiſite things <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth,</hi> from the <hi>Moſs</hi> and <hi>imperfect Plants,</hi> to the Graſs made for the Cattel, to all things growing in the whole Garden of Nature, and <hi>more peculiarly</hi> made for the ſervice of man; among all the <hi>Herbs, Flowers, Shrubs,</hi> and <hi>Trees</hi> of all ſorts, and ſee in them the ſo <hi>fair Characters</hi> of the infinite Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs of the great Creator, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten moſt legibly on them.</p>
               <p>I may Meditate on all ſorts of living Creatures, from the leaſt and <hi>loweſt Mite</hi> or <hi>Inſect,</hi> all creeping things, with all Beaſts and Birds, that go upon the Earth, wild or tame.</p>
               <p>Conſider I may their ſeveral Natures, Features, and Shapes, Beauties, and Excellencies; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the ſerviceableneſs and uſefulneſs of them, to that poor <hi>Clod of earth, man,</hi> for whom they are,</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:47560:82"/>
               <p>I may look to the Waters, Fountains, Rivers, and vaſt Seas, with the innumerable things and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures about and in them, Fowls, Fiſhes, and theſe of ſo many Kinds, Forms, and Shapes; all of them the demonſtrations of the infinite glories of that unimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Artiſt the great God. My Meditation alſo may, with the Pſalmiſt, take in the <hi>eternal and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Hills and Mountains,</hi> with the <hi>Rocks, Sands, and Bulwarks</hi> made againſt the raging Seas, <hi>that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn not again to cover the earth, Pſal.</hi> 104.9.</p>
               <p>I may go up to the <hi>higher ſtories</hi> of this <hi>Fabrick of the World,</hi> to the <hi>Waters above,</hi> to the <hi>Clouds</hi> and their <hi>Bottleings up of Waters</hi> in them, and that ſo <hi>great wonder</hi> in Nature, the <hi>inviſible</hi> and ſo <hi>powerful Wind,</hi> which carries the Clouds from place to place, whereby they at length open, fall down, and water the thirſty Earth with Dews and Showrs; they alſo ſerve to purge and purfie the Air we breathe in.</p>
               <p>I may eye other ſorts of <hi>Meteors</hi> or <hi>Exhalations,</hi> and things appearing in the Air, as thoſe <hi>fiery</hi> and <hi>dreadful ſometimes impreſſions,</hi> making us to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; the <hi>falling</hi> Stars, <hi>flying</hi> Dragons, <hi>fiery dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of ſome, and <hi>fixing ſtanding</hi> brightneſſes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of ſeveral ſhapes.

               <p>

               <p>I may go yet one <hi>ſtep higher</hi> to that <hi>third Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Palace of God,</hi> where alſo <hi>Chriſt is</hi> in his humane Nature exalted, and appearing in higheſt glory: It is alſo the <hi>native place</hi> of the glorious Angels, and the place of <hi>happy reception,</hi> entertainment, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, <hi>of the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, Heb.</hi> 12.23.

               <p>But among all, I may <hi>more peculiarly muſe,</hi> and in <hi>muſing</hi> greatly <hi>wonder</hi> at that one thing, namely <hi>Man, Pſ.</hi> 8. the making of him in ſo <hi>great excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,</hi> and all things in the World for his uſe and ſervice; <hi>all for a little ſpeek of duſt,</hi> with a <hi>little ſpark</hi> in it of an <hi>immortal ſoul.</hi> O what is man, <hi>that a God ſhould be ſo mindful of him,</hi> and do ſo for him!

               <p>If I ſtill daily let my thoughts <hi>run</hi> and <hi>ravel</hi> out in <hi>vanities</hi> and <hi>impertinencies,</hi> and can fix no where uſefully for my <hi>ſpiritual good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in that multitudes of things may breed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, prudence muſt direct to find out the beſt

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. It is beſt here to begin with the <hi>Meditation</hi> of the <hi>infallible certainty,</hi> of this ſo ſuperabounding <hi>heart deceitfulneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. This firſt is to be minded, as that <hi>which is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted ſo by a God,</hi> for whom <hi>it is impoſſible to lie, Heb.</hi> 6. being infinitely <hi>wiſe, holy, righteous,</hi> and <hi>good;</hi> he affirms it, and that <hi>before,</hi> and <hi>to the very faces of all perſons:</hi> He hath <hi>written, recorded</hi> it in his Scripture of truth; he <hi>hath commanded</hi> all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>to read</hi> what he hath there <hi>recorded;</hi> he hath <hi>preſerved miraculouſly</hi> theſe <hi>Records</hi> againſt all <hi>haters</hi> and <hi>oppoſers, Men</hi> and <hi>Devils;</hi> and among other ends, that men may have a <hi>Glaſs,</hi> a <hi>perfect unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Glaſs,</hi> to ſhew men that they never would or could ſee or believe, if God had not held this
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:47560:85"/>Glaſs to them, and made the true and lively repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the <hi>hearts deceitfulneſs above all things</hi> by it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe <hi>Scripture aſſertions</hi> of the <hi>hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs,</hi> are from that God, who is the only both <hi>heart-framer</hi> and <hi>heart-ſearcher</hi> and <hi>knower, Pſ.</hi> 33.15. having his Eye, <hi>omniſcient Eye</hi> alſo, <hi>every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and leaſt <hi>particle of time</hi> upon it, and <hi>every where,</hi> in every Chamber and corner, every part of it; therefore he muſt needs know exactly all the <hi>hearts deceitfulneſs,</hi> and <hi>deſperate wickdneſs.</hi> As he made the whole frame of the Soul, and <hi>all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> the <hi>Springs</hi> and <hi>Wheels</hi> of that exquiſite frame, ſo he knows all the <hi>foulneſs</hi> and <hi>ſoil</hi> of ſin which hath <hi>fallen in,</hi> and which it hath <hi>gathered,</hi> all its <hi>motions irregular,</hi> all its <hi>ſtops and ſtands,</hi> all its <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions</hi> and <hi>omiſſions,</hi> all its <hi>defects of principles,</hi> all its <hi>corrupt principles:</hi> Therefore knowing the both natural powers of the Soul, with all <hi>ſuperadded cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt principles</hi> evilly inclining, <hi>aims and intereſts</hi> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſing and leading: he keeping alſo ſuch an Eye ever upon it; for of the things in the whole world, there's no one thing the Eye of God looks ſo upon as <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> and <hi>hearts:</hi> He muſt know the <hi>deceitfulneſs of it,</hi> by being the only <hi>Maker,</hi> and likewiſe the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual <hi>Obſerver</hi> of it; and therefore if he affirms it how <hi>deceitful</hi> the heart is, it muſt be ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But beſides, there can be nothing in the heart to <hi>alter and change</hi> it, to <hi>reſtore and raiſe</hi> it from this bad ſtate, but he <hi>knows</hi> it; his Eye is ever upon the heart, he keeps alway an <hi>awakened Eye,</hi> that is ſtill watching it, narrowly viewing it; he is the heart continual <hi>ſearcher</hi> and <hi>tryer, Pſal.</hi> 7.9. <hi>He tries the heart and the reins.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:47560:85"/>
               <p n="4">4. He muſt alſo be <hi>Judge</hi> of the ſecrets of mens hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. <hi>God ſhall judge the ſecrets of mens hearts, &amp;c.</hi> therefore all deceitfulneſs of it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt know it, and it muſt be true, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.2. <hi>The Judgment of God is according to truth,</hi> and the Word of <hi>truth</hi> whereby he will judge.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Take in alſo the <hi>recorded demonſtrations</hi> of it, ſuch as God <hi>diſcovered, foretold,</hi> and after came to paſs, ſetting a ſeal to this <hi>infallible truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hazael</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8.19. was by <hi>Revelation</hi> from God, told it by <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and with much <hi>ſeeming ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence</hi> diſclaim'd it, yet <hi>inſtantly</hi> is confuted, and had his mouth ſtopt. The Apoſtles were told of their forſaking Chriſt, and <hi>Peter</hi> of his <hi>denying</hi> of him, which he would not believe, <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.50. yet within a very little time appeared: Scripture Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the <hi>hearts great deceitfulneſs</hi> are left us to <hi>conclude</hi> and confirm us herein. But O how hard is it to ſee, <hi>to believe againſt our ſelves!</hi> Our own great frequencies of <hi>Experiences,</hi> the very inſtances out of <hi>the Nurſeries of our own hearts;</hi> the evil Plants that put forth freſh continually of their fruits <hi>deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> prove it to our faces, if we make Obſervations of them as we ought to do. O there's not one day if we are watchful, but is full of <hi>ſad inſtances</hi> from Morning to Night: At all times we may find our hearts ready to <hi>commit cheats upon</hi> our ſelves, and in ſoul concerns, as to our ſpiritual Eſtates, O what grand deceits are we too apt to have therein!</p>
               <p>As particularly, in reſpect of God, how ready to think erroneouſly of him; as to his <hi>omniſcience, truth, holineſs, righteouſneſs, mercy, free Grace, power,</hi> and <hi>providence,</hi> and ſuch like? As the ſelf condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Drunkard, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19. ſays, <hi>I ſhall have peace
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47560:86"/>though I adde drunkenneſs to thirſt:</hi> And he in the 50. <hi>Pſalm v.</hi> 21. <hi>Thou ſaidſt I was like to thee:</hi> ſo the beſt are out of predominant corruption, very ready to commit <hi>great miſtakes</hi> and <hi>deceits,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their own ſins, <hi>graces,</hi> the things of God, and things of the world, there's no end of naming; excellent Treatiſes are written of this <hi>hearts deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Meditation ſhould proceed to the <hi>unſpeakable ſadneſs</hi> of this heart Temper, every one ſhould cry out with the holy Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart!</hi> out of the hands of this Deceiver ſo great and ſo near, gotten ſo far within me, and that will be a <hi>curſed inmate,</hi> ſo long as this Houſe of the Body ſtands, and will not out utterly whatſoever hard u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage it finds!</p>
               <p>O how ſad is it to have ſuch a <hi>ſelf-betraying</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, ſo deeply rooted within me! To have in my own Boſom, ſuch a <hi>continual Forge</hi> and <hi>Fountain,</hi> acting and running in ſo <hi>violent Tydes,</hi> high Spring-Tydes, ever and anon, carrying me down <hi>to that I muſt ſo ſadly bewail,</hi> and ſmart under!</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>attendants</hi> and <hi>conſequences</hi> of this <hi>heart deceitfulneſs</hi> ſhould <hi>greatly</hi> be pondered, as to be <hi>ſo fooled by</hi> my ſelf, by truſting my ſelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.26. <hi>He that truſts his own heart is a Fool:</hi> May I not truſt my own heart, without having ſuch a Character and Brand upon me? O then what a Fool have I been, and that Millions of Millions of times? O how great a Fool exceeding often, in ſuffering ſo <hi>notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cheats</hi> to be put upon me? ſuch a Luſt or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to clap a Biaſs on my Heart, and <hi>Fool lead me?</hi> lead me ſo far, ſo deep into the <hi>dirt,</hi> ſo far
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47560:86"/>from <hi>home,</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> from <hi>peace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, hope,</hi> and <hi>heart of returning!</hi> How many and many ways have I been a <hi>fool?</hi> yea and ſtill am daily moſt <hi>unwiſe;</hi> he that is ſo <hi>eaſily</hi> and <hi>ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unwiſe,</hi> muſt be a <hi>fool to purpoſe.</hi> Whoſoever ſhall be but <hi>twice or thrice cheated by the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and not beware, will be accounted no wiſe man; but for a <hi>ſinner</hi> to be not <hi>twice,</hi> or <hi>thrice</hi> cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>but thouſands of times</hi> by the ſame <hi>deceitful heart;</hi> cheated with the ſaddeſt, ſaddeſt imaginable <hi>deceits,</hi> muſt be unwiſe indeed. O how ſad is it that we cannot <hi>by all experiences</hi> take heed of this <hi>deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I can take heed of every one <hi>better than my ſelf;</hi> it may be I ſcarce will truſt any body <hi>in worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,</hi> but <hi>my ſelf</hi> that is worſe than any without me, that I will <hi>truſt,</hi> and ſo be deceived: O let me often think what <hi>truſting my own heart is,</hi> and needs muſt come unto.</p>
               <p>I had need think well of the <hi>fooliſh Builder, Mat.</hi> 7.26. <hi>that built his houſe upon the ſand,</hi> grounded his hopes of <hi>ſalvation</hi> on a falſe bottom; and of <hi>the wiſe Builder, who built his houſe on a Rock,</hi> by real building, by precious Faith on Chriſt. And let me likewiſe <hi>meditate</hi> often on the <hi>ten Virgins,</hi> the <hi>fooliſh deceived</hi> with a Lamp of <hi>outward profeſſion</hi> only, and <hi>the wiſe</hi> that with their <hi>Lamps</hi> provided Oyl, of Grace, a heart <hi>right-renovation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Meditate, firſt, on the heart-knower.</hi> Againſt <hi>heart deceitfulneſs,</hi> let me as the ſure way <hi>look up continually</hi> to the only perfect heart-knower, to beg moſt earneſtly his help, to ſhew me my <hi>hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, on Chriſt my wiſdom.</hi> Let me mind this
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47560:87"/>well, <hi>that Chriſt only</hi> muſt be my <hi>wiſdom,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.31. my <hi>teacher,</hi> whom I muſt apply, and reſt on pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly for his wiſdom and teachings daily, to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate</hi> and carry me out of the Labyrinths, and many ſecret windings of my ſo <hi>deceitful ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, on the Spirit my helper.</hi> And muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the <hi>mighty helper,</hi> the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> to help me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my ſelf-deceivings, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>He helps our infirmities,</hi> and he helps againſt this infirmity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ready to be cheated.</p>
               <p>Chriſt by his Spirit, he can and will deliver me if I truſt upon him, he hath given me his Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, the Word.</hi> I muſt meditate on the Word, there are the <hi>ſure Rules</hi> and <hi>ways</hi> revealed, to ſhew how <hi>to undeceive my ſelf:</hi> The Word, <hi>Heb,</hi> 4.12. <hi>is a diſcerner of the thoughts, and intents of the heart;</hi> if I make it my Exerciſe to meditate in the Word of Chriſt, he by his Spirit with the Word will teach and help me, if I obey it.</p>
               <p>I have endeavoured a little, this being ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a concernment, to help our Meditation in it; and thoſe that <hi>believe and fear</hi> their hearts deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings moſt, will ever ſpeed beſt; thoſe <hi>that truſt</hi> their hearts <hi>moſt,</hi> will ſmart moſt.</p>

               <p n="6">6. SOlemn and ſerious Meditation, a very great and diligent conſideration, I ſhould often act in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to that <hi>arch Enemy</hi> without, namely the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, who though he be an Enemy without, yet gains and maintains all he can, a <hi>correſpondency</hi> with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption within me.</p>
               <p>Satan I muſt conſider <hi>as fallen from God,</hi> and ſo from his primitive ſtation and happineſs, into dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Hell, <hi>fallen out implacably</hi> with God, and for his ſake with his <hi>beſt Creature</hi> on Earth, man.

               <p>He hath <hi>the higher ground</hi> of us by far, as being a Spirit, and of the higheſt rank of Creatures, as to his Nature and Eſſence, and is thereby <hi>moſt wiſe</hi> and <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>agile:</hi> He <hi>is immortal,</hi> never can dye, nor in <hi>any ſort decay,</hi> as we and other creatures decay in ſtrength, ſenſes, and exerciſing of our ſouls facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, underſtanding, memory and others; as he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dying, nor in the leaſt decaying, ſo <hi>he hath been,</hi> is and ever will be to the worlds end, <hi>trying</hi> and

               <p>He alſo <hi>enlarges his experiences,</hi> puts ſtill <hi>freſh</hi> on his file; <hi>improves</hi> continually his arts of deceiving; and doth he not grow more bold, raging, and buſie, as his time grows ſhorter? <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.12.</p>
               <p>Pondered well it ſhould be, that <hi>'tis not one ſingle Devil</hi> to tempt us, but there are <hi>Legions,</hi> very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them; and they are all one huge Army of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, under one great Head, <hi>The Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Mat.</hi> 25.41. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.7.

               </p>
               <p>Oft in Scripture mention is made of Satan and the Devil, as if he were a ſingle one: But this may be to ſhew their unanimity and unity.</p>
               <p>The Scripture hath ſufficiently warned us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated his attempts and prevailings; as <hi>firſt upon A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam and Eve</hi> in their ſtate of innocency and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; yet he then (though they knew not only their own happineſs, but all their poſterities, though never ſo numerous, lay at the ſtake) he then by his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices, and ſubtlety prevailed.</p>
               <p>After that, <hi>upon the ſecond man</hi> that ever was, upon the <hi>deceived Parents</hi> firſt born <hi>Cain,</hi> therefore 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Cain</hi> is ſaid to be of the wicked one; and on ſundry other wicked all along ſtill the current of time.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Meditation of Death.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>uncertainty of life</hi> laſt mentioned, leads me to the ſubject next akin to it, that ſo <hi>conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> and <hi>conſequential point</hi> of <hi>Mortality, Death,</hi> and <hi>Diſſolution.</hi> O that here I could be <hi>the higheſt Artiſt</hi> to ſpeak moſt <hi>fitly</hi> and <hi>movingly</hi> to this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>Death,</hi> or at leaſt to do ſomething which might prove effectual to ſome ſuch proper and <hi>proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate way</hi> of directing and quickning this ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and uſeful Meditation. This is the <hi>great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous</hi> and moſt highly concerning thing, the end and winding up of life, and all affairs and matters relating to it, and that which <hi>caſts me,</hi> and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines my condition <hi>for all Eternity</hi> in woe or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Let me therefore endeavour the <hi>beſt I can</hi> at all times to improve my thinkings of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let me firſt begin with the <hi>meritorious cauſe of it:</hi> That which <hi>Heathens</hi> knew not, <hi>Nature</hi> ſaw not, <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> could not find out, nor reach; only holy Scripture tells me, and ſhews it to be that moſt <hi>black inlet</hi> ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Death en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the world by ſin,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>By one mans of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence death reigned;</hi> not only entred, but reigned, hath maſtered, and will maſter all ſinners. <hi>Sin, that greateſt evil</hi> in the world, <hi>ſin</hi> the only contrariety to the living God that gave life to man at firſt, and ever ſince; <hi>ſin,</hi> that only <hi>injury</hi> to the bleſſed God, bred and brought death, the greateſt miſery to man here;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:47560:90"/>
                  <hi>ſin</hi> that provoked God to paſs the ſentence; <hi>ſin</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioning the vindictive cauſe, the <hi>Juſtice of God,</hi> to let in death, death with the conſequences of it, that would follow without a Mediator that <hi>Adam</hi> knew not of: Death ſo conſidered, is the way of the very <hi>deepeſt revenge</hi> a God can take.</p>
               <p>But then this black part of it, <hi>bodily death,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that blacker Train of <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Eternity</hi> in it, is that which muſt challenge a very great proportion of <hi>ponderings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Let me look at, not only the riſe of it, and the bare wrath occaſioning the inflicting it, but that ſo <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>irreverſible ſentence,</hi> that like the Law of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> cannot be broken, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. <hi>It's appointed for all;</hi> the <hi>univerſality of ſin</hi> hath given death an <hi>univerſal ſting;</hi> and the Statute of Heaven hath <hi>impowered</hi> Death's Extenſiveneſs over all, and ſet a <hi>ſeal of irrevocableneſs</hi> to it as to all men. Therefore it is appointed, I muſt think, <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly</hi> for me; whatever I am, or do, or can in utmoſt poſſibility do. I muſt not <hi>once think</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an eſcape from it.</p>
               <p>Yea let me conſider, as I muſt die, ſo the <hi>very Year, Moneth, Day, Hour,</hi> and <hi>Moment</hi> is <hi>immutably fixt,</hi> and can never be altered, <hi>Job.</hi> 14.5. the <hi>place</hi> alſo where, the <hi>means</hi> whereby, the <hi>manner how,</hi> all <hi>circumſtances</hi> about it are unchangeably deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But how material is that particular of the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty</hi> of the time and manner to me? that's a <hi>reſervation</hi> and <hi>ſecret</hi> kept in the Lord's <hi>own breaſt,</hi> not poſſibly to be exactly known before, without it be revealed, as Chriſt of the Great Day of Judgment ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.36. <hi>Of that day and hour knoweth no
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:47560:91"/>man.</hi> And Verſe 42. <hi>Ye know not what hour your Lord will come.</hi> And 44. <hi>In ſuch an hour you think not your Lord comes;</hi> ſo the two latter may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to this of death, when he calls <hi>for an accompt</hi> of our Stewardſhips and Talents, and paſſes <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> and <hi>perſonal Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Let me paſs next, to the Meditation, ſerious pondering of <hi>the nature</hi> of it, and that great dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of that <hi>moſt terrible of terribles, that King of terrours, Job.</hi> 18.14. Here that I may <hi>duly</hi> look on it, let me <hi>look up</hi> for a God to <hi>teach</hi> me, as to number my days, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 90. ſo to be <hi>wiſe</hi> to conſider my latter end, to do that <hi>hard</hi> work, <hi>overcome</hi> that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of <hi>looking Death-watd.</hi> Nature <hi>abhors</hi> the thinking of it, Corruption all it can <hi>oppoſes</hi> it; but <hi>Grace</hi> muſt bring and fix earneſtly and often the Eye upon it, <hi>familiarize</hi> death to me, let me then <hi>Eye my diſſolution,</hi> the parting of the two <hi>neareſt, deareſt</hi> friends, the Soul's taking its ſad farewel of its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dwelling; its going, <hi>going in an inſtant</hi> out of the Body, and then <hi>that which Death</hi> doth as an <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> to all former Life concerns; and as an <hi>entrance</hi> upon an Eternal Condition.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As <hi>an Enemy to all enjoyments</hi> how ſweet ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: Pleaſures all now quenched, Honours now all daſht, Riches and Eſtate now all loſt, Power now utterly ceaſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An Enemy to <hi>all Relations,</hi> Friends, Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; now muſt I ſhake hands with all neareſt and deareſt, the ſweeteſt and moſt helpful Relations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An <hi>Enemy to all Imployments,</hi> neceſſary or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable, no Work, no Buſineſs, no Invention after it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. An <hi>Enemy to all Opportunities and Means</hi> of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:47560:91"/>Grace, never to <hi>read</hi> the <hi>Bible</hi> more, <hi>never</hi> to <hi>hear</hi> one <hi>Sermon</hi> more, <hi>never</hi> to receive the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> more, <hi>never</hi> to make one <hi>Prayer,</hi> the ſhorteſt of one of the feweſt words more; and then alſo when thou art <hi>juſt launching</hi> into the <hi>length</hi> of <hi>vaſt Eternity:</hi> But now muſt be <hi>Prayerleſs</hi> and totally <hi>helpleſs,</hi> yea now thy Souls condition becomes <hi>becalmed,</hi> and thou canſt not obtain one <hi>gale of the Holy Spirit</hi> to blow upon thee, and help move thee in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Its an <hi>Enemy quickly</hi> to the curious frame and ſo exquiſite building of thy body, with all its parts and members, made with ſuch <hi>adaptations</hi> and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs whatever, with all the <hi>Tempers, Qualities, Offices, Abilities,</hi> and <hi>Actings</hi> of it: An <hi>Enemy</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to all the <hi>ſenſes; ſeeing, hearing,</hi> the <hi>two diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinary,</hi> with <hi>feeling, taſting, ſmelling,</hi> the ſo likewiſe <hi>neceſsary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. It is an <hi>Enemy</hi> and <hi>Deſtroyer</hi> of all <hi>comlineſs,</hi> and <hi>beauty, form</hi> and <hi>ſhape:</hi> And <hi>all theſe former</hi> by being the <hi>Enemy</hi> and <hi>Deſtroyer</hi> of that thy ſo <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>precious life;</hi> by making that <hi>Jewel drop</hi> out of the Cabinet of the Body: or rather <hi>driving</hi> forth thy <hi>immortal</hi> and <hi>invaluable</hi> ſoul, bringing with it a <hi>Writ of forcible entrance,</hi> coming with an <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to turn out that <hi>old inhabitant</hi> of the body, <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing it from regaining poſſeſſion, making it ſtand empty,</hi> and <hi>thence expoſing the body to rot, ruine, turn to duſt,</hi> and expoſe it to <hi>Oblivion,</hi> as if it had never been.</p>
               <p>But then <hi>upon thy Souls</hi> thus leaving thy Body, <hi>immediately</hi> and <hi>inſtantly</hi> it is caſt upon a ſtate of Eternity; of Miſery if thou wert not in Chriſt, or <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity</hi> if found and dying in him.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:47560:92"/>
               <p>When Life ends, Eternity begins: O this all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing <hi>Eternity;</hi> this <hi>ſo vaſt</hi> and <hi>inconceivable Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> no <hi>way</hi> to be expreſt or ſet forth, <hi>no way</hi> to be underſtood or known, a <hi>Glaſs</hi> that is ever run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, a <hi>Chain that is ever lengthening:</hi> who can number the <hi>Sands</hi> of this <hi>Glaſs,</hi> who can reckon the <hi>links</hi> of this <hi>Chain</hi> of <hi>Eternity,</hi> without <hi>ſtop</hi> or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, <hi>bound</hi> or <hi>end?

               </p>
               <p>But <hi>to affect my ſpirit aright,</hi> and be wiſe in the due managing of this <hi>Meditation of dreadful Death,</hi> let me <hi>look to</hi> and ponder the Scripture <hi>Commands,</hi> for remembring and conſidering my latter end, <hi>and the Arguments</hi> ſtrongly inducing to it.

               <p>Let me therefore not only <hi>muſe on the ſentence,</hi> the <hi>peremptory</hi> and <hi>irrevocable ſentence</hi> paſſed upon all in general, and ſo upon my ſelf in particular, but on it as <hi>ready to be executed this hour,</hi> yea <hi>this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> for ought I, or any in the world can tell: Ah let me ſay to my ſelf, <hi>the Warrant</hi> for my death at this <hi>very inſtant</hi> may be ſealing, and <hi>immediately</hi> in a moment put in Execution.

                  <hi>Decay in Beauty and Comlineſs.</hi> Sometimes, yea ordinarily, when we are in <hi>the Flower,</hi> preſently the Beauty and Comlineſs begins to blaſt: The <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>faireſt Face,</hi> as to the pure White and Red, ſoon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becomes <hi>paler,</hi> or <hi>higher coloured,</hi> after grows <hi>darker</hi> and <hi>deader,</hi> ſtill <hi>one</hi> way or <hi>other</hi> worſe.

By this, the ſoon decaying of the <hi>bardeſt pieces,</hi> Death ſeems to ſet his <hi>black mark</hi> on us, we have his <hi>mark in the mouth;</hi> and by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayings and rottings we <hi>touch,</hi> as it were, theſe his warnings continually with <hi>our Tongues,</hi> thence to mind us of what change is coming.</p>

               <p>But if theſe-Deaths Marks begin not ſo in ſome, yet how do we find <hi>generally</hi> ſome other marks of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay ſet upon us?</p>
               <p>If Death come <hi>not early,</hi> yet how ſoon upon moſt doth he <hi>ſet his mark? moſt obſervably</hi> on the very <hi>top</hi> of our <hi>Houſes of Clay,</hi> bringing forth gray Hairs on <hi>the higheſt part,</hi> the Head, and turning them <hi>whiter</hi> every day; <hi>Making the Almond Tree to flouriſh,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> elegantly in <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. And in how many E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legancies doth there the Wiſe man diſcover and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent rarely</hi> the decays of the Body in old age? all as <hi>demonſtrations</hi> of Deaths being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually buſie about us, both to prepare and reduce us to his poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>What <hi>varieties</hi> of warnings are given us in the <hi>impairings</hi> of this or that Member, or of ſeveral parts of the Body; by ſometimes <hi>Sores, Impoſthumes, Fiſtulas, Gangrens,</hi> and parts corrupting, ſhewing a coming diſſolution: How many mortal Diſeaſes (beſides others ſhaking the Houſes of our frail Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) I ſay incurable Diſeaſes, whereby we are told that Death hath us now faſt in his hand?</p>
               <p>If not ſo, yet what warnings otherwiſe are given, in the <hi>ſenſes beginning to fail?</hi> as our Sight growing dimmer, Hearing duller, and in the reſt. And as in the parts more common, ſo in the <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal</hi> parts, in the <hi>Liver, Heart, Head,</hi> and others; theſe not performing ſo perfectly their Offices, whence the ſpirits, ſtrength, and motion are <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh</hi> waſtes, the <hi>Skin</hi> wrinkles, <hi>Memory</hi> and <hi>

What are all theſe ſucceſſions of <hi>decays,</hi> but ſo many <hi>added links</hi> of that <hi>great Chain</hi> Death holds in his hand, and <hi>draws</hi> us to him by? All Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that have the ſound of their <hi>Maſters feet,</hi> Death behind them.</p>
               <p>O how exceeding gracious is God in his <hi>Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> and <hi>Connexions</hi> of warnings, who might ſmite every Sinner, without any notice of death given!</p>
               <p>Therefore as a piece of <hi>higheſt wiſdom,</hi> let me ſtrive to repreſent the poſſible <hi>ſuddenneſs</hi> of Deaths ſad coming upon me; and this by all the <hi>ways</hi> and <hi>inducements</hi> I can apply. The <hi>Examples,</hi> ſuch <hi>as are in Scripture,</hi> of <hi>Abels</hi> death, <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah, Amnon, Abner, Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira, Herod,</hi> and others: And in <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> of ſo many and ſo various ways ſuddenly ſnatcht away.</p>
               <p>Not a Year, or ſome ſmall portion of time, but it furniſhes with <hi>freſh Examples:</hi> What hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen others, may befall me, I have no ſecurity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſudden death; but whereſoever, and in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever time <hi>death</hi> may ſeize me.</p>
               <p>If I Travel, a <hi>Thief</hi> may kill me, my <hi>Horſe</hi> may throw and kill me, the <hi>Coach</hi> or <hi>Carriage</hi> I paſs in may ruine me; on the <hi>Water,</hi> I may there be drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; on the Land, and when I am paſſing in the Streets, ſome <hi>caſualty</hi> may diſpatch me; at <hi>home,</hi> by ſome <hi>miſchance</hi> or <hi>ſudden diſtemper,</hi> ſomething at the Table, Fire, Bed, or other place, within or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doors; ſome Impoſthume, Palſey, Apoplexy kills, or ſome venomous inward vapour may ſtrike me to the heart.</p>
               <p>Multitudes of Experiences we continually have:
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:47560:94"/>If not ſuddenly Death ſeizes, but is a ſtroke with warning, either ſhorter or longer, yet it comes at laſt, in the way, and at a time, or hour I juſt know not.</p>
               <p>My beſt way therefore is to, <hi>frequently</hi> in my thoughts, put my ſelf into the condition of a <hi>preſent dying:</hi> How it muſt be with me, let me look on my ſelf how <hi>certainly,</hi> without <hi>flattery,</hi> I am prepared <hi>to dye!</hi> If I have a Chriſt in my <hi>boſom,</hi> the <hi>Love of God</hi> aſſured, and can dye in the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. dye in Faith, and look Death in the face boldly, reſign up my ſoul free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into <hi>Chriſts hands,</hi> theſe make for this <hi>Agony</hi> the <hi>higheſt Cordial;</hi> theſe furniſh me with <hi>Armour</hi> of proof againſt this Enemy.</p>
               <p>But let me then look on my ſelf as having <hi>no means</hi> farther to preſerve me, all <hi>Phyſick, Art,</hi> and <hi>Experiences</hi> withdrawing their uſual help, <hi>Friends</hi> ſtanding about me, pitying, lamenting me, but not able to evidence more than their kind wiſhes, and I my ſelf perceiving <hi>Deaths ſummons</hi> ſent me, as to King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> but without expecting any Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger after to be ſent with better News: Prayers now and all ſuch means alſo <hi>reverſed,</hi> and proving la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours loſt, I now feeling my decays and haſtening away; my diſquiets and <hi>pains</hi> encreaſing, <hi>ſtrength</hi> failing, <hi>ſpirits</hi> ſinking, <hi>heat</hi> turned into chillneſs; <hi>Cramps,</hi> contractions of Nerves and limbs follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>breath</hi> ſhortening, <hi>ſpeech</hi> faultring, <hi>heart</hi> pangs and agonies now multiplying, the whole frame of the body <hi>ſhaking,</hi> the Hands <hi>ſnatching, Eye-ſtrings,</hi> as they ſay, <hi>breaking;</hi> and after many deep heavy ſighings and groanings, the Soul <hi>comes forth</hi> with gaſpings, and ſitting upon my <hi>quivering</hi>

               <p>Lord teach me <hi>ſo to number my days,</hi> ſee how frail I am, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.1. let me ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten realize this dying to my ſelf, in moſt ſerious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, put my ſelf into this condition of Deaths coming, and acting his part, his utmoſt on me, that I may both <hi>familiarize</hi> and <hi>facilitate</hi> this ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and difficult work, that I may be greatly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be <hi>diſſolved,</hi> and be thereby with Chriſt, which is beſt of all; O that I may perform this laſt work beſt! which that I may, and make that great Enemy my great Friend, my Loſſes <hi>greateſt Gain,</hi> let me ſtill mind Chriſt's healing this <hi>bitter water,</hi> making it ſweet, making this <hi>Deaths-day</hi> better than the <hi>Births-day;</hi> let my thoughts be on the Sting's pulling out, that it cannot hurt, if I am Chriſt's.</p>
               <p>Death is ours if we are Chriſt's, and for our moſt high advantages, as being the great <hi>outlet</hi> of all evil and miſery, I now ſhall ſin no more, be tempted and enſnared no more, the World ſhall now be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions bait, and Satans Hook no more, Satan ſhall never <hi>throw at me</hi> any fiery dart more, God will never <hi>deſert me,</hi> hide his face from me more.</p>
               <p>All Miſeries, Croſſes, Loſſes, Poverty, Shame, Pain, Sickneſs, Weakneſs, Wearineſs, Faintneſs, Hunger, Thirſt, Cold, Nakedneſs, Labour, Toil, Cares, Fears, Sorrows, and Diſquiets, and whatſoever of this lifes Evils can be named, is at an Eternal end.</p>
               <p>And Death becomes the great <hi>inlet</hi> of all good, to flow in moſt abundantly; a paſſage to Heaven,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47560:95"/>to be poſſeſt of a Crown of Glory, to enjoy the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable company of Saints and Angels, to be with Chriſt, and ſeeing God face to face, and fulneſs of felicity for evermore.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Of Judgment after death.</head>
               <p>ON the <hi>ſad parting</hi> of thoſe two deareſt friends, Soul and Body comes inſtantly the <hi>doom</hi> and <hi>ſentence, Heb.</hi> 9.27. the <hi>particular</hi> Judgment of the perſon, to paſs and be put in execution, to an Eternal Eſtate, either of Happineſs or Miſery, <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> as to the immortal Soul, and afterward at the General Reſurrection of Body and Soul in Conjunction.</p>
               <p>This therefore <hi>little foregoing Day of Judgment,</hi> upon which, by the Bodies <hi>mortality</hi> and neceſſity of dying, and the Souls <hi>immortality</hi> and neceſſity of not dying, every perſon comes to be ſtated in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>miſery</hi> or <hi>happineſs</hi> unavoidably; is a point of moſt high conſequence, to be well conſidered, deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weighed, often dwelt upon in our <hi>moſt prudent</hi> improvements of retiredneſs.</p>
               <p>A very great frequency, and repetition of our beſt thoughts and ſerious ponderings, muſt be the Tribute of this concern, this vertical point, this
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:47560:96"/>Judgment which caſts the <hi>ſcales,</hi> and makes full <hi>weight</hi> for <hi>miſery</hi> or <hi>felicity</hi> for ever; <hi>For as the tree falls, ſo it lies,</hi> as Death leaves, Judgment, this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Judgment, finds us, dooms us <hi>irreverſibly;</hi> there is no bringing a <hi>Writ of Errour,</hi> no <hi>Appeal</hi> to be made, no <hi>pardon</hi> now the Judge will give, no <hi>petition</hi> he will receive, no ſtay of proceedings can in the leaſt be granted, or lookt for on any ground.</p>
               <p>This to every particulat perſon <hi>in ſome reſpect</hi> is his great day of Judgment, this <hi>diſpoſes</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatches,</hi> this <hi>ſecures</hi> and <hi>keeps</hi> me for the great ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſize and Judgment; this is the Foundation that will be the Superſtructure, this is ſecret, that is ſolemn, this for a <hi>private execution,</hi> that for one in <hi>open view</hi> of all.</p>
               <p>But this Judgment particular ſtrikes the firſt ſtroke of utter undoing, or lends the firſt hand of help to an eternal ſaving, and without which the great Judgment doth not proceed.</p>
               <p>Ah then well may I afford this Judgment a great frequency, largeneſs, &amp; ſeriouſneſs of thoughts, which <hi>launches</hi> the Ship of my Soul into the Ocean of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which lets my Soul, either preſently to ſink into the Bottomleſs Pit, purpoſely ſends it thither, caſts it into the Lake of Everlaſting Fire, or ſends it into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom, into the harbour of eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and enters this Jewel into the Cabinet of Heaven. Ah how unſpeakably conſiderable is this particular Judgment! The very moment of my death, that is uncertain, and the very next moment after death comes <hi>certain Judgment, irreſiſtably,</hi> and <hi>irrecoverably,</hi> and determines our ſtate of Eternity.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> Of the general Judgment Day.</head>
               <p>BUT then particular Judgment foregoing, this is but the foundation and introduction of the following.</p>
               <p>The private and partial <hi>execution</hi> on the Soul <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate</hi> from the Body, ſhall have a <hi>publick</hi> and moſt <hi>ſolemn</hi> both <hi>manifeſtation</hi> and <hi>conſummation</hi> with it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This day, among <hi>other ends,</hi> is reſerved for the ſo <hi>great</hi> and <hi>glorious manifeſtation</hi> of the <hi>infinite ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs, grace</hi> and <hi>mercy, wrath</hi> and <hi>ſeverity,</hi> and other <hi>Attributes</hi> of God; never in this <hi>world</hi> having their ſo full <hi>diſcovery,</hi> as now by the <hi>intendment</hi> and <hi>moſt wiſe contrivance</hi> of a God they ſhall have, before <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints, Devils</hi> and <hi>wicked men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Judgment-day, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. is called <hi>the day of the Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God;</hi> of that righteouſneſs, that ſo <hi>great</hi> and <hi>glorious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute</hi> ſo little <hi>underſtood,</hi> leſs <hi>conſidered,</hi> ſo much queſtioned and cavil'd at, the <hi>higheſt declaration</hi> and <hi>fulleſt Revelation</hi> that ever was, ſhall be then <hi>made</hi> and <hi>ſeen</hi> by all.</p>
               <p>So the <hi>reſt</hi> of Gods <hi>Attributes</hi> ſhall obtain their <hi>meridian height,</hi> and ſhine forth in their moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reſplendencies.</p>
               <p>Therefore it needs muſt be a very great day when it is ſo intended, purpoſely to be <hi>the greateſt day</hi> that <hi>ever was</hi> or <hi>can</hi> be.</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:47560:97"/>
               <p n="2">2. It is alſo <hi>purpoſely conſtituted</hi> for the higheſt glory of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that he may both be admired of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> and magnified in the ſight of all wicked men and Devils.</p>
               <p>Therefore he now is to appear in the <hi>higheſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſplendour,</hi> and <hi>power:</hi> And he being made now the viſible <hi>Judge,</hi> this muſt be moſt glorious, in that it is the <hi>conſummating work</hi> of his <hi>Mediatory King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> preceding immediately his <hi>delivering</hi> up his <hi>Kingdom</hi> to <hi>God the Father,</hi> as the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. For the <hi>method</hi> and moſt fruitful way of this ſo very neceſſary Meditation, I conceive it may be,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To begin with thoſe Scriptures that moſt <hi>clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>diſtinctly</hi> preſent us with the <hi>infallible cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> of this grand point.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To then gather up the <hi>Remarkable particulars</hi> of it in Scripture, as to the Nature, Manner, and the things that both accompany and follow it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How to manage it, to our being beſt moved and ſtirred up by it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the <hi>infallible certainty</hi> of this <hi>Judgment day,</hi> let me look out thoſe Scriptures in the Old and New Teſtament, that ſpeak perſpicuouſly of it, and then labour by Meditation and Prayer to <hi>ſink deep</hi> into my heart, to lay them ſo ſtrongly to infuſe, as to leave a <hi>deep</hi> abiding <hi>tincture</hi> upon it.</p>
               <p>To be put into a full poſſeſſion and aſſurance of Faith, in this ſo high <hi>ſoul-concernment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Jude</hi> 14. <hi>Enoch</hi> the ſeventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> that ſo walked with God, and that was firſt tranſlated, propheſied of the Lords coming to Judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Job,</hi> who is ſuppoſed by the Learned to have lived when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and before
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47560:97"/>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> time, in his 19. <hi>Chapter,</hi> 25, 26, 27. <hi>verſes,</hi> hath a moſt clear and full aſſertion of his Redeemers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laſt day on the Earth, and ſeeing him then, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon, Eccl.</hi> 12.16. <hi>God ſhall bring every thing to Judgment,</hi> every ſecret thing, good or evil: <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. <hi>They that ſleep in the duſt ſhall ariſe, ſome to ſhame, others to life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the New Teſtament, out of Chriſts the <hi>Judges own mouth, Math</hi> 25.31. to the end. This Doctrine is moſt fully, with the particulars and manner of it, deſcribed, and in the other Goſpels often.</p>
               <p>So the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.19. At <hi>Athens,</hi> the great <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of the World,</hi> he tells them God had appointed a day to Judge the World in <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>by the man Jeſus, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 2.16. In that day that <hi>God</hi> ſhall Judge the ſecrets of mens hearts.</p>
               <p>So we muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Chriſt ſhall come in flaming fire, to render vengeance to all that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.12, 13. to the end, <hi>I ſaw the dead ſtand before God, and judged according to their works, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>varieties</hi> of places in Scripture, are like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Candles lighted in one place, like multitudes of Lights in the Heavens, all to give light to us below, that we might have cleareſt diſcoveries, firmeſt Faith, ſtrongeſt inſtigations to yield full compliance and obedience, with greateſt readineſs, pleaſure and ſweetneſs.</p>
               <p>O I muſt anſwer for having the Scriptures, the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:47560:98"/>
                  <hi>varieties, perſpicuities, convincing Reaſons,</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading endeavours</hi> of the Spirit of God towards me <hi>in them</hi> and <hi>by them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The more in the Scripture is done for me, the more will be required of me: This for the firſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The particulars <hi>remarkable</hi> to be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, of this day, as the <hi>nature, manner, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I muſt meditate of the <hi>Perſon,</hi> the ſo <hi>great</hi> and <hi>glorious Perſon</hi> that ſhall be Judge, which is God himſelf, as the Scripture often tells us; as <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. as was mentioned before, <hi>God ſhall judge, &amp;c.</hi> Though this be greatly conſiderable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which our Faith muſt be concluded; and this alone well pondered may greatly awaken, awe, and provoke us to all fulneſs of regard and care: yet the Word tells us farther, it is God, <hi>by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſo in <hi>Acts</hi> 17.19. <hi>God hath appointed a day in which he will judge the World, by that man he hath appointed.

               </p>
               <p>It is not committed to the holieſt man that ever lived, nor to any mighty Angel, it is too <hi>high</hi> an Honour, too great a Work, for any created Nature, only fit for him that is <hi>God and man.</hi> For, by being God, there's both an Omniſcient, and Omnipotent, an infinitely Holy, Righteous, Good, and Merciful Judge; And by being Man, there's to all mens eyes a <hi>viſible Judge,</hi> that the Scriptures may be fulfilled. And this for the <hi>Saints</hi> ſurpaſſing joy, but the <hi>wickeds</hi> greater daunting and terrour, let in by the <hi>eyes</hi> both of the one and other: All muſt be judged by a Judge <hi>their eyes ſhall behold.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> Of Meditation of Hell, and Death Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal therein.</head>
               <p>THE very <hi>naming of Death</hi> is dreadful, Death Eternal is much more dreadful, but a being in Hell, the worſt place poſſible, is moſt dreadful of all.</p>
               <p>Hell, though in the meer mentioning it makes ſuch a <hi>jarr</hi> upon the ſpirit of any; though the <hi>leaſt</hi> touching on it, by a but <hi>glancing</hi> thought, the leaſt touch be like the <hi>needles</hi> ſharp point to the <hi>Apple</hi> of the Eye, ſo acute a pain and ſmart; yet muſt the Eye of the ſoul, by Meditation, not only touch it, but take it cloſe to it, but dwell upon it.</p>
               <p>Death natural, in the but very thought, hath a very <hi>high attending regret,</hi> we cannot endure to look <hi>deathward,</hi> but O how greatly unwilling to look in the leaſt this ſad way, <hi>deſtruction-ward, Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> toward death Eternal!</p>
               <p>The firſt is <hi>taſting Gall,</hi> but the ſecond is a <hi>drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poyſon:</hi> The one hath a deep attending <hi>reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> the other a <hi>double died antipathy.</hi> It's the <hi>harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> task for a ſinner, it's a hard for a <hi>Saint,</hi> to fix willingly, and dwell in Meditation, on ſo ſad and dreadful a ſubject as Hell is: yet is it that, which muſt be done, and by a holy wiſe ſpirit, may be both confidently and advantageouſly done. <hi>The beſt Chriſtian on earth will loſe nothing by ſometimes looking into Hell, and fixing the thoughts there.</hi> No
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:47560:101"/>man ever yet <hi>fled</hi> from Hell, but firſt fixt his thoughts in ſome proportion on it: No man will <hi>flye faſt enough</hi> from this Pit of perdition, this Lake of Fire, if he do not oft look towards it, and <hi>keep</hi> his Eye upon it.</p>
               <p>Hell and Death Eternal are ſet down in Scripture, for both evil and good mens <hi>flying;</hi> but this cannot be compaſt without frequencies of earneſt ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and meditatings.</p>
               <p>For a right proceeding in this Meditation,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let me <hi>firſt look</hi> to that which is my infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rule, the teſtimony of that God, who founded Hell and laid the corner ſtone of it; who firſt threatned and prepared this Priſon, this Pit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; who knows all the large dimenſions of it, all things in and about it, and cannot, nor will not, in the leaſt deceive us in it.</p>
               <p>He hath given us his Word, to tell us, and that under his <hi>own hand,</hi> in great numbers and varieties of paſſages, that we cannot <hi>rationally</hi> conceive, he would ſo do, mention and give it <hi>ſo many times</hi> under his own hand, were there <hi>no ſuch thing,</hi> no local Hell, and ſecond Death Eternal.</p>
               <p>My way therefore, as a <hi>good</hi> Chriſtian, is to look up, gather Scripture paſſages; paſſage after paſſage, all over the Book of God, as I find this aſſerted in them. O ſhall my lives time ravel out, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny redeeming it, as to this particular, of giving due, down weight of thoughts, frequent ſerious thoughts, as opportunity can be had, of Death E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal in Hell?</p>
               <p>I muſt not only ſay, there is a Hell: I muſt not only give it for granted, as moſt perſons do, but I muſt be concluded under the Scripture Authority;
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47560:101"/>See it and ſay it, upon due perſwaſion, upon clear <hi>demonſtration,</hi> demonſtration on <hi>concluſive</hi> argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Arguments choſen as ſo many <hi>Arrows</hi> taken out of Chriſts <hi>Quiver</hi> the Scriptures, <hi>levell'd</hi> right, flying round up to the mark, and <hi>hitting full</hi> my unbelieving and <hi>recoiling</hi> averſe ſpirit, making it <hi>fall</hi> down under this weighty truth, <hi>reducing</hi> it through Chriſts help, to a firm and <hi>operative belief,</hi> yea ſo to aſſent to, and ponder this ſo high concern, as to work off all my uſual <hi>wonted eaſineſs</hi> and <hi>ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of thinkings on this particular: And to arrive at a contrary <hi>habitual ſeriouſneſs,</hi> and earneſtneſs of mindings, <hi>frequent</hi> thinkings; yea let my ſpirit not reſt, till I am reduced to, and improve, under the powerful and prevailing provocations of it, to whatever ſo great a thing calls for from me.</p>
               <p>That I may daily more anſwer the <hi>intendments</hi> of a God, in relating this Hell, ſo plainly and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in his Word, for my due <hi>notice</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>My way then muſt be, a <hi>courſe of ſerious</hi> pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Scriptures; paſſage after paſſage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſecond Death and Hell is ſet forth, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Books.</p>
               <p>As in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.1. <hi>Tophet is prepared of old, even for the King, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and much wood, the breath of the Lord like a ſtream of Brimſtone doth kindle it.</hi> An ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant deſcription in an alluſion: So thoſe many <hi>clear paſſages</hi> of Chriſts own mouth ſet down ſo plainly, as words can utter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 5.22. and 29, 30. In that very firſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Chriſts on the Mount, there he mentions <hi>Hell-fire,</hi> and <hi>caſting into Hell,</hi> three ſeveral times. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.23. <hi>Brought down to Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:47560:102"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 16.23. <hi>The Rich man</hi> is ſaid <hi>to be in Hell. Pet.—It's called a Priſon,</hi> Priſons being the worſ: of places, made for ſecuring and puniſhing. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.1. A bottomleſs Pit. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.23. A place of <hi>torment. Mat—Their worm dieth not,</hi> alluding to that worm that breeds in, and feeds on the body, is lying gnawing and cannot be cured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their fire goes not out:</hi> Fire is the moſt quick and active, the moſt tormenting and torturing Element. It's <hi>Brimſtone</hi> that is the fuel, which is a moſt combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible, noiſom and ſuffocating matter.</p>
               <p>It's call'd <hi>utter darkneſs:</hi> Darkneſs is a moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and diſconſolating thing, as that of <hi>Egypt:</hi> For the company, it is only wicked perſons perfect in ſin, and moſt wretched Devils, the worſt of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: <hi>Go ye curſed into everlaſting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O how hot and ſcorching muſt that fire be, that purpoſely is prepared for utmoſt torment? Not like <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Furnace ſeven times hoter, but ſeventy times hoter, that which is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable.</p>
               <p>In Scripture, Hell or the ſtate of miſery, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt by the terms of <hi>ſecond death;</hi> death, one death in any kind is very dreadful, above all other things: but after <hi>dying a firſt death,</hi> then to come and dye a <hi>ſecond death,</hi> and this not ſo eaſie as dying any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily death millions of times over. If a Malefactor ſhould die the moſt cruel death, and <hi>then be made to live again,</hi> and then <hi>die that death</hi> a ſecond time, yea thouſands and thouſands of times over, O how ſad were the caſe of that perſon, that muſt be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the both fears of that death firſt, and then the torments and pains! But what is all this to this
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:47560:102"/>
                  <hi>ſecond death,</hi> being under the fullneſs of infinite wrath, and that for ever?</p>
               <p>The <hi>inflicter</hi> of this miſery, is no leſs than an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely wiſe, holy, ſin hating, and an omnipotent God: <hi>acting</hi> in the pureſt and fierceſt wrath, <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring</hi> the fulleſt revenge the damned creature is capable of, and for which it <hi>purpoſely</hi> is made a veſſel of wrath, and that veſſel is <hi>preared</hi> to receive and hold this wrath.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Prepared by being <hi>widened, extended,</hi> as it were, to receive the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of wrath. As the Saints ſhall have their ſpirits elevated and extended, to the utmoſt, to be made fit to receive the fulneſs of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and happineſs: ſo the damned have their <hi>ſpirits widened</hi> and enlarged, their <hi>underſtandings</hi> and <hi>hearts</hi> in the <hi>utmoſt extenſiveneſs,</hi> that they be brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of wrath.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Prepared by being purpoſely <hi>ſtrengthened</hi> to the utmoſt, as Veſſels are made ſtrong to hold the ſtrongeſt Wine or Liquor, to hold and keep in that wrath poured into them.</p>
               <p>Were Hell but to have the leaſt torment in the leaſt member, or ſenſible part, as in the Toe, Finger, or the like for ever: or but one torment in a noble part, Head, Liver, Heart, or a <hi>complication</hi> of many ſad diſeaſes for ever; how intolerably ſad were this ſtate? but to <hi>have all poſſible</hi> trouble and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both in body and ſoul, ſet on by a God for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: O how unſpeakably ſad is this?</p>
               <p>All the forenamed, this <hi>impriſonment,</hi> this tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, this worm, this fire, the weepings, the wailings, the gnaſhing of teeth, is not for an <hi>hour,</hi> a <hi>day,</hi> a <hi>month,</hi> a <hi>year,</hi> an <hi>age,</hi> nor a <hi>thouſand years</hi> or <hi>ages,</hi> or what can be reckon'd, <hi>by millions of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47560:103"/>millions,</hi> but for ever; no <hi>reſt for ever,</hi> no <hi>eaſe for ever,</hi> no hope of any deliverance, or <hi>degree</hi> of it for ever: but ſorrow, torment, and terrour, ſinking in deſpair and hopeleſneſs for ever, ever, ever.</p>
               <p>O then to improve this Meditation, and make it operative upon my ſpirit, Let me firſt look upon Hell begun, in that terrour and horrour, the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſtantly upon their raiſing up from the dead, and changed, are ſeized with: The hot burning Coals of Hell are thrown into their boſom, fill them up and lie burning and ſcorching, as they are both <hi>bringing</hi> to the judgment ſeat, and <hi>are ſtanding</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt at the Bar, all the <hi>time</hi> of their arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Never did any poor guilty priſoner ſtand <hi>in ſuch a fear</hi> as this fear, and were ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The then unſpeakable ſhame.</hi> Then all <hi>the time</hi> of their arraignment, and eſpecially on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of that dreadful ſentence which will be paſſed and executed: O what muſt be the unſpeakable ſhame, mixt with the continuing and encreaſing ſad horrour, <hi>Dan.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>O what muſt be <hi>that ſhame,</hi> when all things poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible concur, to load and cover them with ſhame? never was there nor can be <hi>ſuch a ſhame</hi> poured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any.</p>
               <p>A ſhame in the <hi>greateſt concourſe,</hi> that ever was, or can be; all the Saints and Angels, yea all the wicked and the Devils, every particular aſhamed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo before all their own company, in this ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtate. 3. And eſpecially a tranſcendent <hi>ſhame,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>infinitely glorious</hi> Judge, the Lord Jeſus, deſpiſed and ſinned ſo againſt by ſo many.</p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:47560:103"/>
               <p>Ah what muſt be the ſhame of wicked men, to ſtand uncover'd, with open faces, to ſee the ſo <hi>dreadful Judge,</hi> looking the arraigned perſon full in <hi>the face,</hi> looking with the moſt <hi>wiſhly</hi> Eye, and <hi>ſtern countenance</hi> upon, I ſay, their <hi>uncover'd faces?</hi> to have all their ſins ript up, every one adding ſtill to the ſhame; but then when the dreadful ſentence paſſes, O what the ſhame will farther then be?</p>
               <p>And yet far more, when the ſentence is Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, they driven away, and all Devils and men, thruſt into the Dungeon of darkneſs, what an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſhame will that be? Now, O now to think of all their unexpreſſible loſſes, of ſuch a Bill of loſſes, as never was ſeen; loſs of God himſelf, his face and communion with him, Father, Son, and Spirit; loſs of the company of all the Saints and Angels, loſt Heaven, and all its glory loſt, and all that happineſs that ariſes from all; ſuch a ſtate as is ſo good and glorious, to that utmoſt poſſibility as the Creature is ſuſceptive of and can have; and for that <hi>ſo all ſweetning</hi> and ſatiating eternity: And then, which greatly aggravates the miſery, as Chriſt himſelf expreſſes it, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.28. <hi>There ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth, when ye ſhall ſee</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>and all, &amp;c.</hi> So to ſee all the Saints, to ſee all the godly Patriarchs, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and all the other.</p>
               <p>To ſee <hi>Moſes, Samuel, David,</hi> and all the holy Prophets, to ſee all the bleſſed Apoſtles, <hi>Peter, John, Paul,</hi> and all the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of Chriſt, with all the glorious <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> in all times; and all the innumerable company of <hi>Saints,</hi> in both former, preſent, and after Ages; all theſe known in
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47560:104"/>their times; but neglected, ſcorned, oppoſed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, and deſtroyed, yet all theſe to be taken up with Chriſt into Heaven; but as other ſinners, ſo thy woful ſelf dying without a Chriſt, ſhut out, and have Heaven Gates ſhut up, lockt and barr'd againſt thee for ever; and withal alſo, ah lockt up faſt in the Dungeon of darkneſs, and fill'd up full in ſoul and body, with unſpeakable torment never to end.</p>
               <p>And to realize this more, and make it more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual on thee that art ſaved, after the Judgment is ended, ſentence of condemnation paſſed, let me imagine my ſelf looking after this <hi>Herd of Goats,</hi> all driving down headlong to the <hi>Lake of fire</hi> and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, ſeeing them <hi>taken hold of,</hi> and <hi>haled</hi> to the Priſon of Hell, and immediately ſhut in, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeis'd with wrath and torment, fill'd brim full up, with unſpeakable woe and torture.</p>
               <p>Then could I but go near, <hi>lay my ear</hi> to the door of this Priſon, and liſten earneſtly, O what would be the <hi>dolours,</hi> the groanings, cryings, roarings, yellings, ſhriekings, that ſo many, &amp; many thouſands, <hi>altogether tortured,</hi> would be heard to make. The noiſe of a few Priſoners <hi>condemning,</hi> of Paſſengers in a Ship <hi>drowning,</hi> of men in Battel <hi>killing and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> makes a moſt hideous <hi>impreſſion,</hi> makes a mans ears to tingle, and his heart to ake and tremble: But, O what is, or can be like unto this hideous noiſe and cry, of ſo many innumerable millions, of all ſorts and ſexes, men and women, under ſuch into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable torments? O but might I have <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>ſecurity</hi> to make an <hi>ocular obſervation,</hi> with my eyes to ſee the <hi>Gates</hi> of that horrid place open, to ſee <hi>the lake</hi> of Fire and Brimſtone flaming, <hi>to look in</hi>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:47560:104"/>and ſee the tormented in their ſo woful condition, <hi>moſt ſad poſtures</hi> and <hi>behaviours:</hi> All the multitudes and throngs of perſons, and the perſons in <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> I deſire to ſee and view. There I might ſee that firſt Murderer <hi>Cain,</hi> appearing in his Chains and Tortures, and on my demanding who he was, he <hi>anſwers,</hi> I am that curſed one, that kill'd my righteous Brother <hi>Abel;</hi> here, here I have bin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, ſo many thouſands of years, and here I muſt remain to be tormented for ever.</p>
               <p>In <hi>another place</hi> appears another, it may be <hi>wicked Saul,</hi> that perſecuter of holy <hi>David;</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Achitophel,</hi> or <hi>Haman, Herod, Judas,</hi> and abundance of ſuch <hi>ſtrewed all over</hi> this Priſon: Sinners of all ſorts, Idolaters, Superſtitious, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, Wizards, Witches, Swearers, Curſers, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaners of the day of God, with diſobedient to Parents, Murderers, Adulterers, Thieves, Lyars, Covetous, and all others of ſeveral Sexes, Ranks, and Conditions.</p>
               <p>If I might <hi>ask</hi> and <hi>be anſwered,</hi> upon enquiry, by the perſons I ſee there, would not one come and ſay, <hi>I am ſuch a one,</hi> another ſay, <hi>I am ſuch;</hi> and ſo others? Would not one come and ſhew me, there in ſuch a place are thoſe that were <hi>drowned by the Deluge;</hi> there are the <hi>Sodomites</hi> burnt with fire and Brimſtone; <hi>there's Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> thoſe drowned in the Red Sea; there's ſuch and ſuch Enemies and Perſecuters of Chriſt and his Church of old; there are the <hi>heathen Perſecuters,</hi> and the Antichriſtian Enemies; there <hi>ſuch Apoſtates,</hi> ſuch Hypocrites, ſuch <hi>looſe Chriſtians;</hi> in this <hi>place</hi> ſuch a man or ſuch a woman you knew, and in that <hi>place</hi> another; there you ſee them, and in the ſame ſad caſe with my ſelf?</p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:47560:105"/>
               <p>But ſhould I <hi>ask</hi> of their ſeveral conditions, and what they continually feel, O what <hi>doleful Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> would they give in, of the <hi>ſcorchings</hi> of that fire, of the <hi>gnawing</hi> of that never dying worm, of their <hi>deepeſt ſorrows, higheſt fears;</hi> and above all, of their <hi>overwhelming</hi> and unſpeakable deſpairs? <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14. Here when God ſuffers <hi>but a ſpark to flye out of the Furnace of Hell, and fall into a ſinners boſom,</hi> as <hi>Judas, Math.</hi> 27.5. O how intolerable doth it prove? But when the <hi>whole pile of Hell's fuel and fire</hi> ſhall be laid and faſtned on ſinners by the hand of an Almighty God; O what muſt that torment and that deſpair amount unto, and then when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>infallible certainty</hi> of a lengthening out to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity?</p>
               <p>O let every one Meditate <hi>often</hi> and <hi>moſt ſeriouſly,</hi> of this <hi>ſo dreadful ſtate;</hi> not be <hi>ſhye</hi> of a looking this way, of a <hi>looking into this Lake</hi> of Fire, and <hi>realizing</hi> all the ſo dreadful things comprehended in it: Not contenting thy ſelf with <hi>thy yieldings and giving it for granted,</hi> and never ponder, never la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to any purpoſe, to be rightly affected, ſtirred up to take a ſure courſe for eſcaping it. But let this <hi>terrour of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. awaken, provoke, and perſwade every one to flye from this wrath to come; and flye to that Chriſt, make ſure of him that only can deliver us.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> Of Heaven and Happineſs Eternal.</head>
               <p>THE laſt thing I ſhall mention in this part of ſolemn and ſet Meditation, is that of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Happineſs Eternal therein; Hell is not <hi>ſo miſerable</hi> a ſtate, but Heaven is as tranſcendently glorious and happy: The one being purpoſely for <hi>demonſtration</hi> of the fulneſs of Gods hatred and wrath, the other for the <hi>higheſt manifeſtation</hi> of the riches of Mercy and Free Grace. Yea this being the thing the Lord is ſo infinitely pleaſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in, muſt needs have <hi>the fulleſt</hi> and moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manifeſtation that is any way poſſible for a <hi>God</hi> to make, and his Creatures can be <hi>apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi> and <hi>receptive</hi> of, and therefore <hi>the ſtate of Glory muſt be glorious</hi> indeed, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, ear hath not heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive, what God hath prepared for ſuch as love him.</hi> There he is ſpeaking of things but <hi>diſpoſitive</hi> to happineſs, the bleſſings of Grace, Peace, Joy, and heavenly Priviledges given in Chriſt: but then, if happineſs only begun, be ſo glorious, O what is <hi>happineſs finiſhed up,</hi> and conſummate?</p>
               <p>For our way of proceeding in this Meditation, I conceive it beſt, by <hi>laying a full</hi> Scripture ground, in <hi>gathering</hi> thoſe choice Flowers, ſpringing up thick, in the <hi>rich Garden ſtores</hi> of the infallible Scriptures, and are purpoſely <hi>growing there</hi> for the hand of <hi>faith to gather,</hi> and the <hi>Eye</hi> of our dim weak ſight,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:47560:106"/>to be healed and cleared, to believe and ſee the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Heaven by.</p>
               <p>It is not a way of meer <hi>general thinkings,</hi> or that of <hi>Phanſie</hi> or <hi>Speculation</hi> of our own, but firſt <hi>lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Scripture, great and firm foundation:</hi> And then after to improve thoſe Scripture aſſertions, by all <hi>the ability</hi> and help we can, of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Inferences</hi> of beſt <hi>Repreſentations</hi> and <hi>Reſemblances,</hi> of <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination</hi> and <hi>Invention.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>General apprehenſions, and <hi>grantings of Scripture truths, deceive and deſtroy many,</hi> when they are reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in: General <hi>notions</hi> of Heaven and happineſs; granting it there is a Heaven and <hi>no more,</hi> makes many miſs of it, miſs for want of <hi>more diſtinct ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, well grounded</hi> believing, and <hi>due deep ſinking of it</hi> to the bottom of the heart, there to lie <hi>glowing,</hi> to warm and kindle the affections, to provoke into a labouring, a mighty ſtriving to win the Crown of glory.</p>
               <p>The way is (as wiſdom in all other caſes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence teaches) <hi>to come off every day from general confuſed thoughts of Heaven and happineſs,</hi> reſtings on and runnings away with a ſuppoſed doing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
               <p>If we ſtill grant there's a Heaven and Happineſs, every day to <hi>endeavour diſtincter</hi> and clearer thoughts and knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Generals</hi> will not ſerve, <hi>grantings</hi> muſt not be made <hi>the enough of a wiſe Chriſtian,</hi> he muſt have an <hi>extenſive and enlarging clearneſs, an encreaſing firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of Faith, in the Doctrines, the great points of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. But we having this ſo prime an Article of faith, that which hath <hi>wrapt up in it</hi> ſo rich a Treaſure
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:47560:106"/>and <hi>preſerves,</hi> as it were, that ſo ineſtimable Jewel of happineſs, mans laſt end; that which is the great foundation and inſtigation of all a Chriſtians ſtrivings and hopes (for he hath no hope in this life for happineſs here.)</p>
               <p>This therefore ſhould not be <hi>turned off,</hi> nor <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated</hi> (as too oft is done) with <hi>a granting</hi> or <hi>bare aſſent;</hi> but ſtill obtain of us a fuller, firmer, warmer, and more operative ſeeing and belief.</p>
               <p>Now this cannot be, without <hi>diligent gathering in,</hi> and <hi>better ſtill Meditating</hi> on particular <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, aſſerting,</hi> and <hi>clearly manifeſting</hi> this main Article, and mans chief end compriſed in it.</p>
               <p>The Jewiſh Church had this typified in the Holy of Holies, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.3.12.24. <hi>Chriſt is not entred into the holy places made with hands, which were the Figures of the true, but into Heaven it ſelf.</hi> This was, that by the viſible place, faith might be ſtirr'd up, to <hi>eye</hi> and <hi>view</hi> the inviſible typified ſtate of glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.24. <hi>David</hi> tells us of it, and was aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>to be received up into glory;</hi> that is into Heaven in glory. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.23. <hi>Of them that ſleep in the duſt, ſome ſhall awake to everlaſting life, and ſhine as the brightneſs of the firmament, and ſome as the ſtars for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings given by Chriſt to it, have this Doctrine of Heaven and happineſs, abundantly and moſt clearly ſet forth. The firſt mentionings of it, are out of the mouth of him, that with the Father and Holy Spirit made it. <hi>Math.</hi> 5.3. in Chriſts firſt Sermon, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</hi> So <hi>verſe</hi> 10, 12. <hi>The perſecuted
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:47560:107"/>for righteouſneſs, theirs is, &amp;c. verſe</hi> 20. Mention there is again of it, <hi>Verſe</hi> 34. and <hi>v.</hi> 45. and 48. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 9. The <hi>firſt paſſage</hi> in the Lord's Prayer. <hi>At leaſt twelve ſeveral times</hi> in this firſt Sermon of Chriſt this Heaven is mentioned. And as in the Goſpels, ſo all the new Teſtament over, you may, <hi>many ſcores of times,</hi> find and ſee it lying, as a <hi>moſt ſhining and glorious Diamond</hi> in the Mine, or as in a rich Cabinet, for to be viewed and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. The multitudes of places, well weighed, muſt needs hold forth, to all that ſhut not their eyes wilfully, <hi>a Local Heaven,</hi> a place of happineſs and glory.</p>
               <p>It is no <hi>Allegorical Heaven,</hi> as ſome have dream'd, or may ignorantly imagine: when it is aſſerted in ſo many clear paſſages, which, all of them, in our reading or hearings, ſhould have their <hi>due weight,</hi> weight of thinkings, and <hi>efficacy on us,</hi> for firm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and anſwerable endeavours for not loſing, but enjoying it.</p>
               <p>For <hi>the rank of places,</hi> what it hath, the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> tells us, it is <hi>the third Heaven;</hi> the firſt being that where the Clouds are; the ſecond where the glorious Lights, Sun, Moon, and Stars are; this third above them all, call'd therefore the <hi>higheſt Heaven.</hi> This <hi>third</hi> and <hi>higheſt Heaven</hi> is moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivably excellent; not made of any <hi>preceeding</hi> matter, much leſs of any <hi>elementary</hi> matter. Some ſay it was made immediately of nothing, and with it were alſo made, <hi>concreated,</hi> the Angels; all at the ſame inſtant, Heaven never being empty of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</p>
               <p>The Sun, Moon, and Stars were <hi>made,</hi> not the firſt day, but the fourth day, for Furniture
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:47560:107"/>of that Heaven, under the <hi>higheſt Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the largeſt, and <hi>moſt capacious place,</hi> as that which <hi>compriſes</hi> or ſurrounds all the inferiour <hi>world,</hi> and <hi>things</hi> in <hi>that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O here, here is <hi>Rechaboth,</hi> room enough.</p>
               <p>In this world, here's <hi>crowding, puſhing, cruſhing,</hi> of the Saints: The wicked world would quite <hi>caſt them,</hi> every one, out of it, to be left alone and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all, to be let alone, and have none to ſee and ſhame them any way: But the Saints ſhall all be brought at laſt, into a <hi>large place,</hi> where none ſhall moleſt or trouble them. Heaven is a <hi>Rechaboth</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a <hi>moſt large place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Globe of the whole Earth and Water,</hi> is, as Geographers tell us, at the leaſt, one and twenty thouſand and ſix hundred miles in compaſs. The <hi>Air</hi> above encompaſſing in that, and <hi>eſpecially the uppermoſt part</hi> of the Air, muſt needs be far more in compaſs than the Earth and Water.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moon alone</hi> is very great, though ſomething leſs than the Earth; ſome of the Planets are judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>far greater</hi> than the <hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>Earth.</hi> The <hi>Sun by ſome</hi> is judged to be <hi>one hundred ſixty ſix times</hi> greater than the <hi>whole Earths Globe;</hi> which <hi>others</hi> make yet far greater: which then muſt be ſome <hi>millions of miles in compaſs,</hi> according to that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. The <hi>fixed Stars,</hi> which all are above the higheſt Planet <hi>Saturn,</hi> are by the <hi>Learned,</hi> every of them, judged <hi>greater</hi> than <hi>all the Earth;</hi> the leaſt of them <hi>eighteen times bigger</hi> than the Earth; thoſe of the higheſt magnitude, and the moſt glorious brightneſs, <hi>an hundred and eighteen times bigger</hi> than the whole Earth. Of theſe <hi>fixed Stars</hi> who can tell the numbers of them? thoſe which are
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:47560:108"/>reckon'd, are but ſome hundreds in their Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. How exceeding then vaſt muſt <hi>this ſtarry Heaven</hi> be, if the <hi>Planets</hi> and <hi>fixed Stars</hi> in it, are ſo great and numerous?</p>
               <p>O then how <hi>unſpeakably vaſt</hi> and large muſt this <hi>third Heaven</hi> be which compaſſes round all the <hi>Earth, Air,</hi> and <hi>the ſtarry Heavens?</hi> What a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for <hi>Territories</hi> is this? <hi>What a place</hi> for Chriſt to prepare Manſions for his in? What a place for the <hi>all-glorious God</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to keep a Court in <hi>higheſt ſplendour</hi> and <hi>magnificence</hi> in? And the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> the Saviour, that purchaſed this inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with his <hi>own blood,</hi> for him to be ever <hi>viewed, loved, admired, glorified</hi> by all his Saints to the higheſt in?</p>
               <p>Of all imaginable places, this, this is the place, this is Room, this is a place ſo <hi>large</hi> as the <hi>hearts</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> can wiſh.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As <hi>Heaven</hi> is the <hi>largeſt</hi> for <hi>capacity</hi> and <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi> ſo is it the <hi>beſt</hi> place for <hi>quality</hi> and <hi>excellency.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. It is called <hi>Paradiſe</hi> by that bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> who was taken up thither, to tell upon his return what a <hi>place</hi> it was. <hi>Paradiſe</hi> mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.8. it was the <hi>beſt place</hi> that ever was on Earth; it was the <hi>ſummary</hi> of all <hi>neceſſaries</hi> and <hi>delicacies</hi> for <hi>Adam,</hi> in that <hi>perfect ſtate,</hi> his <hi>accommodations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,</hi> and <hi>abundant delight;</hi> fit therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the <hi>place of glory</hi> by. And ſo our Lord Chriſt thought, when he calls it by this name of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe; Luke</hi> 23.43. <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe:</hi> The <hi>beſt place it was made,</hi> becauſe for the <hi>beſt Creature on Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 16. <hi>It is called Abraham's boſom: Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in his time was the moſt eminent perſon living,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:47560:108"/>call'd <hi>the Father of the faithful:</hi> No place for a Child can be ſo proper, ſo deſirable, pleaſing, and contenting as the moſt loving tender Fathers Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; O how a Child loves the Boſom! O how deſirous are the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> to be in his Boſom.</p>
               <p>In other places, it is <hi>a place of glory, riches of glory, a Kingdom, a Crown of glory, an eternal weight of glory;</hi> a ſtate where there are <hi>Pleaſures for evermore, Rivers of pleaſures, joys and fullneſs of joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For every Saint the <hi>higheſt entertainments,</hi> in all reſpects; for the <hi>Senſes.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>perſons of the Saints,</hi> as to the numbers ſo innumerable, muſt needs make up the rareſt Train and ſhew (as to their ſorts and differences) that ever Eye ſaw.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> Meditation on ſome things providential.</head>
               <p>THere is but this one thing (which I will briefly diſpatch) remaining yet to be ſpoken of; and then I come to the laſt ſort of Meditation, that is by a <hi>ſhort</hi> and more <hi>ſudden</hi> way, <hi>Ejaculatory Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> I ſay there ſhould be Meditation <hi>on ſomething providential,</hi> a matter the <hi>hand of providence</hi> acts or orders, <hi>holds forth</hi> and <hi>offers</hi> to our viewing and ſerious thinkings. The <hi>great God,</hi> as he always is <hi>guiding</hi> and <hi>ordering</hi> all things in all places, in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veu, Earth,</hi> and <hi>Waters,</hi> and among all <hi>Creatures,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>reaſonable,</hi> and chiefly <hi>above all</hi> in his <hi>Church,</hi> and for his Saints, againſt his and their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. As he is <hi>guiding</hi> with his hand, all <hi>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of particular perſons</hi> to the ſupream end, his own glory, and likewiſe infallibly to the ſalvation of his <hi>Redeemed:</hi> ſo there is ever and anon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>obſervable, particularly providential;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:47560:111"/>which as the <hi>hand</hi> of <hi>providence</hi> holdeth forth, ſo the <hi>heart of prudence</hi> and godly wiſdom will take up; that purpoſely it will ſet it ſelf to <hi>ſee, ſearch,</hi> and <hi>improve;</hi> as it may be ſomething ſometime of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> abroad, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the People of God at home, or in the place particularly we live in: It may be there is ſome diſpenſation, to ſome of our Relations or Friends, or ſome matter falls out in our Family, or yet near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on our perſon and perſonal concerns.</p>
               <p>There is ſeldom any <hi>ſpace of time,</hi> but the great Governour of the World is doing <hi>ſome remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> thing, it may be ſome <hi>admirable and glorious,</hi> it may be ſome <hi>amazing</hi> and <hi>ſtupendious,</hi> it may be ſome <hi>terrible</hi> and <hi>very dreadful</hi> work, if we have our eyes in exerciſe, and will obſerve.</p>
               <p>Indeed Gods goings ſometimes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.19. <hi>His footſteps cannot be ſeen,</hi> but are very ſecret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable. And there are others of his workings, which are more eaſie for all to behold and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
               <p>There are varieties of Providences, ſucceſſively following each others; which we ſhould wait and watch for, which we ſhould take, as they come, <hi>freſh</hi> and <hi>warm</hi> out of the Lords hand, and apply them <hi>warm</hi> to our <hi>hearts</hi> for a more kindly operation.</p>
               <p>Meditate we ſhould upon Providences, while they are <hi>juſt new and freſh,</hi> ſo we ſhall give them, or rather our ſelves, the advantage of a more ready and affectionate pondering, a more profitable mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If I could <hi>ſtill improve</hi> in Meditation of the Promiſes, and in a wiſe, warm, lively alſo <hi>Meditat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of providences;</hi> in the one ſee <hi>better daily</hi> the riches of free Grace, in the other the <hi>glorious governings</hi>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:47560:111"/>of a God in <hi>wiſdom, righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>goodneſs:</hi> How would my ſpirit, <hi>under the dews</hi> of this fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Meditation,</hi> be ſhooting up? how would it proſper? They are the <hi>higheſt form Chriſtians,</hi> that are arrived here, at the contemplation of the works and <hi>great providences</hi> of God in the world.</p>
               <p>In 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.13. He writes to ſome he calls Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, others young men, others Children. Some by Children underſtand, ſuch as are (as to Meditation) taken up with the <hi>promiſes,</hi> and <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, pardon,</hi> and <hi>peace;</hi> young men, are ſuch who are gotten farther, and exercis'd about ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conquering ſtrong corruptions.</p>
               <p>Fathers, that beyond both, are taken up, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at ponderings, and contemplations of the <hi>works</hi> and <hi>ways of God,</hi> and his great actings in the world.</p>
               <p>So it is ſometimes needful to Meditate on the Providences that are <hi>more obliging</hi> and <hi>engaging, more awakening</hi> and inciting, ſuch as are as it were the <hi>ſpecial hand of the Lord touching us, taking bold of us,</hi> framing and ordering things for us. And here there is great reaſon, our Meditation ſhould be more ſerious and curious: as wherein we may ſee Gods ſo particular goings and workings toward us, and for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. All that excellent <hi>Pſalm</hi> over, <hi>David</hi> there enumerates and records all Gods goings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. O then with the Pſalmiſt, let my ſoul meditate on all the works of God; <hi>liſt</hi> and <hi>file</hi> up up the <hi>diſpenſations</hi> of his <hi>obſervable providences</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others and my ſelf: Meditate on his ſo <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful preſervings, directings, proſperings,</hi> and all other ſorts and ways of <hi>Providence;</hi> that I may <hi>admire</hi> and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:47560:112"/>exalt him, <hi>depend,</hi> and <hi>truſt,</hi> and wait upon him, and <hi>walk</hi> ſo before him, that his ways may ever be <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> towards me.</p>
               <p>I have now diſpatcht the <hi>ſecond branch</hi> of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation on particular <hi>Providences;</hi> and thereby the ſecond <hi>general kind</hi> of <hi>Meditation;</hi> which is, <hi>ſet</hi> and <hi>occaſional Meditation</hi> at particular times of lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>

               <p>As there are <hi>ejaculatory Prayers</hi> and wiſhes, when there is not opportunity for more ſolemn enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; there ſhould be alſo <hi>ſudden</hi> and <hi>ſhort medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatings,</hi> quick <hi>interpoſings</hi> of good and holy thoughts, then when the urgencies of Affairs, incumbrances, diverſions and interruptions by company, hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in any kind, will not admit the opportunity of <hi>an abode of ſerious thoughts;</hi> then <hi>ſudden dartings</hi> up the ſoul to Heaven may be had, be <hi>a refreſhment;</hi> as <hi>Jonathans</hi> taſting the <hi>Honey,</hi> with the top of his Rod, when being in <hi>purſuit</hi> of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> he could not take a <hi>full meal.

               <p>This <hi>Meditation,</hi> though of <hi>ſhorter time,</hi> yet ſo

               <p n="2">2. It ſhould be <hi>the product and iſſue of holy linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after God and communion with him;</hi> from a <hi>thirſting</hi> for God to <hi>taſte a little,</hi> when we cannot have fuller draughts of him.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p>Ah how excellent is this frame of ſpirit, how <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>pleaſant</hi> is it to have the Eye often on theſe ſo rare beauties, from being, as <hi>the Spouſe</hi> in the Canticles, <hi>both really and deeply in love!</hi>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:47560:113"/>act, and how our hearts <hi>make ſtill their holy eſcapes</hi> from the <hi>crowd,</hi> and <hi>obſtructings</hi> of <hi>occaſions,</hi> to give him a <hi>friendly, ſpiritual</hi> viſit, to let him ſee the <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> of our <hi>love</hi> by <hi>endeavours</hi> ſo oft as we can, to do him <hi>homage</hi> and <hi>honour:</hi> As when we would ſhew our high reſpect and honour to any perſon, we make the more <hi>frequent viſits,</hi> when we cannot make <hi>long ſtay.</hi> So here when <hi>throngs</hi> of <hi>indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble occaſions,</hi> hinder the ſet and larger <hi>engagements</hi> in <hi>Meditation,</hi> make we it up <hi>in ſhorter viſits,</hi> in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thinkings; <hi>ſhort viſits rightly aim'd bring ſweet peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let it not be therefore <hi>ſo haſty,</hi> as we obſerve ſome Children, call'd to go to a place, <hi>that run with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their errand,</hi> to act without aim; right aiming <hi>the end lays the foundation</hi> of a Dutys excellency: O let my <hi>ſpirit,</hi> if I cannot think and dwell long upon <hi>heavenly things,</hi> through <hi>weakneſs,</hi> let it make up the defect <hi>by thinking often.</hi> Let the <hi>dartings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> be the <hi>livelier</hi> and <hi>thicker,</hi> like a <hi>Golden Chain</hi> which is very long, though the <hi>Links</hi> be very little.</p>
               <p>O let me trade, drive a quick <hi>trade with littles; Light gains make a heavy purſe,</hi> little <hi>frequent tradings</hi> will gain me much here.</p>
               <p>This ſhort often acting up, will make my heart keep ſtill <hi>open to Heaven;</hi> keep the <hi>path-way</hi> thither <hi>beaten plain, eaſie,</hi> and ſo make it <hi>pleaſant</hi> for my <hi>ſpirit</hi> to walk in, make this <hi>Meditation</hi> highly ſweet, a rare <hi>refreſhing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>frequencies</hi> of <hi>thinkings heaven-ward,</hi> will have this threefold advantage, theſe three excellent fruits.</p>

               <p>As conſideration in things Natural, is <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> and neceſſary to due chuſing and doing of all things: ſo <hi>Divine Meditation</hi> is <hi>fundamental</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> in ſome degree to the ſpiritual actings of the Will, movings rightly of the Affections, and a religious regular performing what was piouſly purpoſed, and piouſly firſt ponder'd and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated upon.</p>
               <p>All the <hi>Graces</hi> that make up the <hi>Golden Chain;</hi> the Graces that are the <hi>ſupernatural ſoul enoblements,</hi> that are planted and reſide in a renewed heart <hi>by way of principle and habit,</hi> are planted and laid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſeveral faculties of the Soul, as their <hi>relief</hi> and help, to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> them and <hi>empower them;</hi> ſome in the mind, and others in the will and affections: Theſe faculties have all their ſeveral <hi>Golden Links</hi> of the Chain of Graces aſperſed among them, and laid into them: But as the faculties of the ſoul are all guided, drawn, and moved by the firſt Mover, the underſtanding, and the act of conſidering: So the <hi>graces</hi> of the ſoul, all the <hi>Golden Links</hi> of the whole Chain of Graces muſt move by the firſt Link of the Chain, the light, ſpiritual wiſdom and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of it by this Divine Meditation. This Link muſt draw firſt: Spiritual wiſdom exerciſed in this holy way of Meditation, muſt be a conſtant <hi>foundation</hi> and riſe to all the Duties of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:47560:117"/>
               <p>This ſhould be at <hi>the bottom,</hi> and a ſtill <hi>quickner</hi> to all <hi>prayings, readings, hearings,</hi> and the reſt: <hi>Nothing is well done, that is not firſt well thought on,</hi> although the Duties of godlineſs are <hi>reciprocally help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> mutually lending a hand each to other; as Reading, Hearing, Praying, are to Meditating, and Meditating is to them in different reſpects; yet Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation ſhould and muſt help to make us our <hi>firm, even footing, and lively walking in</hi> Chriſts ways.</p>
               <p>All things from firſt to laſt in our way of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and walking by that Rule, have their due gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and managings by this <hi>helm</hi> and hand of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</p>
               <p>God every where in Scripture, when he would have thoſe <hi>come right and return,</hi> that have gone wrong, and ſuch to <hi>go on</hi> that have well begun, he calls them to conſideration and minding their ways; <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Conſider your own ways in your hearts;</hi> and again, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.8. <hi>Bring it to mind. Put your hearts upon your ways,</hi> in the former; here they muſt bring their doings upon their hearts, by conſidering: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.28. <hi>He conſidereth and turneth.</hi> Conſideration is the riſe of returning: <hi>Luke</hi> 15.17. The Prodigals returning, was upon his conſidering: common wiſdom acting in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, is the ſouls helm; and ſpiritual wiſdom, acting in Meditation, is the Chriſtians Helm; as the Word is his compaſs, and the Gales of the holy Spirit fill his ſails, and make him move. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not look for a Ship to ſail well, without the Helms ſteering well: Meditations Helm muſt ſteer our courſe; our courſe to the Harbour of true happineſs, muſt have its riſe in due conſideration, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture every where ſhews.</p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:47560:117"/>
               <p>O let me, Lord, keep up ever this right order and method in my walkings; let Meditation be the ſpring that carries all the Wheels of my ſpirit right and even; that ſtill pondering all my paths, my ways may be eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>This then I propound, as a principal ground of the neceſſity of Meditation, that dependance of the Will, Affections, and actings ſpiritual, on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſanctifi'd, and furniſht with light and wiſdom for ſalvation; which wiſdom and light is the guide to, and ſtirrer up of the will, affections, and endeavours by the means of Divine Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>This I have the more now inſiſted on, in that the great failings of all ſorts riſe from neglect of this conſideration and Meditation, becauſe this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is no more conſidered.</p>
               <p>All Chriſtians that would have the Will purpoſe, the Affections move, the executing power endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour well, muſt uſe the grace of ſpiritual wiſdom, that is the firſt wheel in the heavenly frame of ſpirit, and wiſdom by the way of Meditation, to ſet on go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the wheels of other graces diſperſt through the heart: The Graces planted as principles of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life, ſtrength, and motion, and given to animate all operation.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXVI.</hi> Of the ſecond ground of this ſo neceſſary Duty of Meditation.</head>
               <p>HEavenly things ſhould have not only a meer ſeeing and knowing, but a minding and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating, from their obliging and challenging excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies (<hi>Prov.</hi> 8.6. and 22.20. Excellent things, have I not written to thee excellent things, ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Phil.</hi> 3.8. <hi>For the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi>) their ſo far tranſcending excellencies, their rare objective excellencies, give me leave to call them ſo; that is, they are not only excellent things in themſelves, though never known or ſhewn to us, but they are made to be excellent objects for our obſervation and minding: All made to be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but ſome of them more peculiarly made and prepared, made great, made high, deep, and large, fil'd brim full, yea running over, with both native excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and likewiſe ſutableneſs for us, ſutableneſs for our ſpirits to act and make their chief abode of ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſeſt thoughts upon; for a ſpiritual and holy eye to fix upon, and be pleaſed in. As in Philoſophy they reaſon, if there be <hi>objectum ſenſibile,</hi> an object of the outward ſenſe (and that which eſpecially is excellent) if there be Odours and rich Scents; if ſounds, excellent ſounds; or if there be rare Colour, Feature, Motion; and that ſo excellent object Light, eſpecially ſuch glorious Lights as the ſeveral Stars, the Moon, and the moſt glorious Sun; there muſt
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:47560:118"/>be thoſe Senſes of ſmelling, hearing, ſeeing, which may perceive their objects and receive the pleaſure and benefit of them, otherwiſe they muſt be all in vain. If there were no Creatures with any Senſes to perceive theſe Objects of Colour, Light, and the reſt, to what end were any of them?</p>
               <p>What uſe would Colour or Light be of, without any eye to behold it? The omniſcient God he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not need it: The Angels and Spirits being without bodies, they do not need it: Creatures blind, and Creatures made without ſenſe; Elements, as Earth, Water, and the other: Elementaries, ſuch as Stones, Metals, Trees, and ſuch like inſenſitive things, they need it not; neither need any ſmells, ſounds, or taſtes, only the ſenſe is ſuted to the Object, and the Object to the ſenſe: The Object is made or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted and ſhewn for the ſenſe.</p>
               <p>So if there be ſpiritual Objects, and no ſpiritual eye fitted for them, and if ſpiritual Objects be held forth and ſhewn, and there were never any eying of them, they then in that reſpect (as to their holding forth) would be in vain: And the ſpiritual eye would be in vain, as if the eye had no Object to behold, it would be in vain, and as no eye at all.</p>
               <p>Therefore doth God in Scripture call ſo oft for a <hi>beholding</hi> of the things of Heaven, becauſe of their excellencies purpoſely ſhewn for that end: <hi>Joh — Behold the Lamb of God.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Behold what love the, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore when there are ſuch abundance of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and heavenly things, ſet out in ſuch rare Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and proportions, ſhining in ſuch high ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and glory: When ſo many moſt bright and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:47560:119"/>beauteous, when ſo great and extenſive rarities and excellencies, beam forth and ſhine ſo gloriouſly in heavenly and ſpiritual things, there then needs muſt be an Eye, a ſpiritual Eye, for theſe ſo excellent Objects, to behold them and be exerciſed about them.</p>
               <p>Yea, when there is ſuch a height, depth, latitude, and length, and vaſtneſs every way, of dimenſions of excellency ſhining in them; and this purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they may be viewed and admired, and alſo improved; therefore there muſt be an anſwerable eying and conſidering.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A real ſincere acting of minding and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating, to anſwer their moſt real worth.</item>
                  <item>2. A deep ſearching of thoughts, to anſwer their height and depth of excellency.</item>
                  <item>3. An abode and dwelling and enlarging of thoughts, to anſwer the latitude and extenſiveneſs of excellency in them, that all their glory and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, ſo near as can be, may be known and taſted.</item>
               </list>

               <p>Therefore we find that great Artiſt in Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the holy Pſalmiſt, ſo buſying his thoughts and meditating in ſeveral things; as about God and his Glory, Greatneſs, Holineſs, Righteouſneſs, Truth, Mercy, Severity, and Power, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.6.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXVII.</hi> Of the third Ground of this Meditation, as to ſeveral ends and uſes.</head>
               <p>THE third great ground of this neceſſary Duty is from the Ends, and the great concernments of them, as to all ſorts of perſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>For a ſinners firſt converſion to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Meditation is a Duty incumbent on, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary for perſons yet ſtrangers to God, to bring them home; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.28. Becauſe he conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and turneth, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.47. If they bethink themſelves and turn; returning of the ſinners is upon conſidering and ſelf bethinking; thus the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>No man ever truly converts to God, without ſome conſideration of his Miſery, with his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute need of Chriſt and his Grace, and flying to him.</p>
               <p>Although the efficacious drawing of a ſinner
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:47560:120"/>be Gods work, he awakens, convinces, humbles, and he changes the heart; yet not without the ſinners conſidering, minding, mourning, ſeeking, and ſtriving. God converts men as reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and converſion is founded on the deepeſt ſet reaſons, and the ſtrongeſt working and prevailing arguments in the world. God he awakens, and the ſinner looks about and conſiders, he reaſons with himſelf, as the Prodigal, and out-reaſons himſelf, but by Gods mighty working, keeping down the hearts corruption, and by its quickning the ſoul with a new living principle, and ſo he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves and returns to God: If more would muſe and conſider, did do it duly, more, God enabling, would return.</p>
               <p>When the one is to be done, the other ſhall be done, men ſhall come to conſider and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For all renewed repenting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There's great neceſſity of conſideration for our renewing our returning continually; for holding up an evenneſs and conſtancy of renewed repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.59. <hi>I conſidered my ways, and turned my feet to thy Teſtimonies:</hi> Freſh godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſelf-loathings, ſerious returnings, muſt have new freſh conſiderings of the ſinfulneſs of ſin, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loads of aggravations on particular new warp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and miſcarriages. Eſpecially greater Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings require a deeper and larger foundation in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, as <hi>David</hi> did in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. that evidences great and deep thoughts of heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>For a vigorous acting of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For vigorous acting any Grace, Faith, Love, Hope, Fear, Humility, Patience, and others, as is
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:47560:120"/>frequently ſeen in the Saints in Scriptures, what reaſons and perſwaſions, they drew out of the depths of conſiderations; <hi>Job, David,</hi> others!</p>
               <p>All the heart Graces are ſtirr'd and acted in ſome meaſure by conſideration, either of the command enjoyning, the Promiſe encouraging, threatning aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, examples exciting, arguments in ſome ſort or other inducing and helping.</p>
               <p>It is ſomething that works and weighs, is firſt pondered before the ſoul acts, or is rightly moved. A Chriſtian acts not as Water or Fire, which move by their own inclination: But as men act in things as men, which is by choice and free election, but upon preceding inſtigation of Reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
               <p>Grace, though it be a ſpring of living water, it is not that which runs over of it ſelf: That's for Heaven, where the heart will be full and run alone: It is not like the ſpring-head of <hi>Jordan,</hi> that ran of it ſelf, but like <hi>Jacob</hi>'s well, that had always water, but muſt always be drawn: It muſt be drawn out by conſideration.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians miſtake and complain oft of their hearts, and would have them like a running Spring, to run, to act alone: when here in the beſt, though there be water, as in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Well; yet the well is deep, there muſt be drawing for every drop, or none will come. Therefore to make it come, the Bucket of Conſideration muſt be letting down, and pulling up, and ſo pouring forth. What the Apoſtle ſaid to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Stir up the gift that is in thee,</hi> muſt be ſaid to all, and done by all, that would do any thing.</p>
               <p>Some Horſes, we ſay, go on meer Metal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:47560:121"/>out provocation of ſwitch or ſpur; others will go well with ſome ſtirring up: So our hearts, if good, will go on in godlineſs, but not on meer Metal, but with provokings of conſiderations.</p>
               <p>There ſhould be endeavoured the beſt and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mindings and reaſonings, if we would act Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vigorouſly and ſtrongly. There's a neceſſity that ſtrong purpoſes and reſolutions, for believing, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, loving, hoping, all acting, all enduring ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; be bottom'd in ſtrong mindings and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: The fuller the conſideration, the better the actings of Graces; the ſtronger the ſpring in the Watch, the better all the Wheels move.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XXVIII.</hi> Of other ends of this Meditation.</head>
               <p n="4">4. FOR all Duties and holy performances, there is great neceſſity of Meditation, in ſome due meaſure, for a due, wiſe, warm, lively, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual acting them, acting from the right principle of Grace within, by the right rule eying the Word, and to the right mark and end, ſalvation: Real and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous performing in this ſort muſt have ſome good allowance of pondering what we are to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
               <p>This is very conſpicuous in holy <hi>David,</hi> ſo great a performer of holy Duties, Praying, confeſſing and praiſing; his prayings, and all things in that way, he calls his Meditation. Certainly, thoſe ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Pſalms of prayings and praiſings were no
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:47560:121"/>flaſhes of a meerly raiſed phanſie, or ſome haſty runnings over of a hot Brain; not an uttering what came next, but the paſſages ſo rare, ſpiritual, and heavenly, and ſo ſtrongly rational; as they had a touch from Heaven in the Spirits guidance and aſſiſtance, ſo they had a tincture from a wiſe holy heart within, laying them aſteep in conſideration, and acting them with it in higheſt heeds and mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, concurring with their utterings. Things ſo well ſpoken, muſt be well weighed, eſpecially when they alſo were to be Scripture Records. For holy Prophets and Scripture Pen-men were to uſe their own natural gifts, and their graces, in their writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, though the Spirit of God infallibly guided, ſometimes raiſed and elevated them above them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Duties of Religion ebb and flow, are more lively, ſpiritual, and heavenly, or more dead, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and ſuch as run lower, according to their fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentings and feedings from the warm ſpring of Meditation; thus in our praying and other duties we may daily experience.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians complain they are dead-hearted and cold, ſlight and perfunctory in performances; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions are not accompanied with heart-meltings, ſhame, and ſelf-loathings; Petitions not with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency, ſtrong cryings, and earneſt wreſtlings; Thankſgivings not with that flame of love, and joy, and high admirings of the ſo great goodneſs, and rich free Grace of God in his ways and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations toward us; commonly the cauſe is, the ſpring of Meditation is ſtopt, the ſoul runs not in ſuch a current of conſiderations and quickning rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as it ought, and uſed to do.</p>
               <p>When any part or member of the body fails in
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:47560:122"/>heat, ſenſe, or motion; where there is <hi>actio laeſa,</hi> as the Phyſicians ſay, there's <hi>principium laeſum;</hi> that is, where is an action or acting hurt or hindred from its natural and uſual way, there the principle and feeder of that action hurt and failing, is hurt and failing it ſelf.</p>
               <p>As when failing of ſence or motion in an Hand or Leg, it's num or cannot ſtir; this is from the cold clammy humors lying at, and obſtructing the heads of thoſe Nerves that did convey motive or ſenſitive ſpirits to that part is num or motionleſs. Now,</p>
               <p>Meditation is a head or riſe of motions ſpiritual, Reaſons and Arguments are as the Nerves that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey and ſtir up heat, ſpirit, and motion into holy performances.</p>
               <p>This is one very great cauſe holy Duties are no more lively and warm, the cure muſt be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the obſtructions, opening the ſpring-head of Meditation, making that run freſh and full in ſuch conſiderations as may warm and quicken: The wiſdom of Chriſtians therefore is to take as we ſaid, that great Artiſts way, the holy Pſalmiſt, that acted godlineſs ſo eminently; and among others up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this eminent acting ſtill of Meditation, he tells how he prayed day and night, and how he ſtill praiſed and highly rendred his thankſgivings and bleſſings, and he tells you how, he meditated day and night.</p>
               <p>And he tells you his Meditation aſſiſted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. He tells you his Prayer was his Meditation, becauſe aſſiſted, quickened, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by Meditation: If Chriſtians would uſe to Meditate more carefully and conſtantly, it would
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:47560:122"/>help to keep up better the vigour of Prayer, ſo would it likewiſe keep life and warmth in all other holy duties.</p>
               <p>No Chriſtians are warmer at the heart, and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier in holy ſervices, than thoſe who meditate moſt; but never expect the one without the other: Keep this Fountain open and ſtill running; this is the water to drive the Mill, the Wind that moves the ſails, the ſpring in the Watch that carries all the Wheels and keeps them going, I ſpeak as to that is to be done on our part, otherwiſe God does all in all.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Meditation is neceſſary to be an excluſive and keeper out of evil and vain thoughts, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge them; naturally all the imaginations of the heart are evil, and only evil continually, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5.</p>
               <p>Vain thoughts lodge and repoſe, as in a Bed, in a carnal heart: <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. <hi>How long ſhall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee? Epheſ.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Walking in the vanity of your minds:</hi> The way and walk is in the vanity of the mind. To diſlodge theſe lodgers, and ſhut them out, is by accuſtoming and exerciſing the mind to good thoughts, to be the excluders of bad thoughts. The Learned Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Bacon</hi> obſerves, as the cures of bodily diſeaſes are by applying things contrary to them, ſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the mind are helpt by contrary ſtudies: Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try makes men witty, Hiſtory wiſe, the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks ſubtil, Natural Philoſophy deep, Moral Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy grave, Logick and Rhetorick able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, theſe Arts help the defects of Nature, by working contrary habits proper for the cure of thoſe defects.</p>
               <p>So in ſpiritual diſtempers and defects, there are
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:47560:123"/>ſutable cures and remedies, by applyings and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the contraries: So <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. If ye mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie <hi>the deeds of the body by the ſpirit:</hi> All ſins, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſins are mortifi'd by thoſe Graces are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to thoſe ſins; ſo diſtruſt is mortified by holy truſting, paſſion and wrath by godly meekneſs, Pride by Humility, worldly affections by heavenly affections ſtill acted, and ſo evil thoughts by good, roving, wandring, and wild imaginations by God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conſideration and Meditation: which accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves unto, will work off cuſtomary, vain, and wandring thoughts; a holy principle of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, the ſinful principle of evil think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>It is not ſo much the ſtriving and tugging againſt corruptions to keep them down, though we muſt both watch and war againſt them, but the acting of the contrary Grace that beſt relieves us; to ſtrive after a bare ſuppreſſing of ſin and of evil thoughts in particular, comes to little.</p>
               <p>This is a kind of being only upon the defenſive; for an obſerving and marking the riſings and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of corruption and ſins, it may be with a good meaſure of grief and reluctancy, but this is rather a telling and reckoning the evil thoughts and ſtirrings, and lying expos'd ſtill to freſh aſſaults, leaving corruptions opportunity to return ſo oft as they will, than to abate and ſuppreſs them: It can do little unleſs we go this way to work: The beſt and neareſt way to diſlodge and exclude evil thoughts, is by lodging and acting good thoughts, in this way, this ordinance of Meditation, which will keep us: God keeps us, when we keep his and our way: The way when they come, as we ſhould
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:47560:123"/>againſt evil thoughts act deteſtation, but withal act diverſion; act not deteſtation alone, but diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Let thy heart both turn inwardly againſt them, and turn alſo from them, by turning upon ſomething is both ſpiritual and ſeaſonable.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as the Poyſon of evil thoughts would <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> take the <hi>antidote,</hi> the beſt preſervative of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to, and acting of good and holy thoughts, the art of diverſion is better than meer acting ſtill of ſtriving and oppoſition.</p>
               <p>Yea, Secondly, Meditation is to be exerciſed, not only as an excluſive of bad thoughts, but for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductive of good thoughts, good thoughts in a way, for an arriving at habitual heavenly minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for an introductive of heavenly mindedneſs, where there was formerly a walking in the vanity of the mind: <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. All the <hi>thoughts of the heart evil continually;</hi> cuſtomarily, habitually evil: for, I ſay, an introductive to heavenly mindedneſs; and likewiſe for an improver of heavenly mindedneſs daily.</p>
               <p>In handling the Explication of the deſcription of Meditation, when the ends of it were mentioned, among other ends, this was one; Meditation muſt be performed to be a moulder and framer of habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual heavenly wiſdom, making the ſpirit of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian habitually wiſe; ſo I adde now, Meditation is to be performed, to introduce, and after that, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove an habitual heavenly mindedneſs.</p>
               <p>It is not only incumbent on thee to ſhut out evil thoughts, and endeavour good thoughts, to take up the old lodgings of the evil, and ſo thruſt and keep them out, but thou muſt by Meditation, by conſtant uſing it, endeavour habitual heavenly mindedneſs.</p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:47560:124"/>
               <p>In all truly gracious hearts, a principle that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines, that introduces a bent and tendency of ſoul <hi>heaven-ward;</hi> but this at the firſt is a tender bud, it is but weak and inclines weakly, acts feebly in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of after time, when it's grown and ſtrengthened by exerciſe; when we exerciſe and uſe to meditate, this dips and dyes the ſpirit into the tincture and Grain Colour of habitual heavenly mindedneſs.</p>
               <p>Though the firſt fundamental inclination, and bent of ſpirit heaven-ward, muſt be <hi>ſought</hi> till it be <hi>found,</hi> the <hi>carnal</hi> earthly mindedneſs changed into <hi>heavenly;</hi> yet this, if we were never ſo aſſured of it, muſt not ſatisfie; here no Chriſtian muſt ſet up: But to the now firſt principle and the fundamental habit obtained, this ſuperadded acquired habit, ſhould be this ſecond grand endeavour, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, firſt to have the ſpiritual habit, the new fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental heart-tendency, then to have this inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion heightened, ripened, and corroborated, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit attain'd upon frequencies and conſtancies of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and uſing this heavenly meditating. This <hi>David,</hi> the excellent example of actings in this high-way to Heaven, God ſays of him, when he was very young, when <hi>Samuel</hi> came to annoint him, he was one whoſe heart he lookt on as being principled with piety and real holineſs, he had a heart inclined, ſet for God and things heavenly; but he acted holineſs, exerciſed himſelf in it, and in this particular way of Meditation, till it ripened and arrived at habitual meditation, from holding up a conſtancy in it. This may be <hi>gathered</hi> from the character he gives of a godly man, and from his own ſtill practice; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. <hi>In the Law of the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:47560:124"/>Lord he meditates day and night;</hi> when a man <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be godly, hath the principle, this will incline him to begin this godlineſs, this meditation:</hi> But then godly wiſdom teaches to practiſe it, for to uſe meditating, to get a hand at this rare work, <hi>to come to an habitual heavenly mindedneſs:</hi> So <hi>David</hi> that was ſo wiſe, ſo excellently wiſe, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.98, 99. he had acted the fundamental principle, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.112. <hi>He inclined his heart to keep all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments alway;</hi> and <hi>he exerciſed meditation to babitual heavenly mindedneſs;</hi> for he tells us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.97. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.6. he <hi>meditated all the day, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated in the night watches; when he ſtill awoke he was ever with God.</hi> He gets the <hi>habitual heavenly mindedneſs,</hi> and then it was <hi>eaſie,</hi> and by being ſound eaſie, it was withal <hi>his delight</hi> Meditation at firſt, the burden and yoke of heavenly Meditation, lying on the weak ſhoulders of the new Convert, with only his <hi>new principle of grace</hi> begun, is a <hi>hard and heavy work;</hi> though the ſpirit be willing, yet to perform it is weak: But when this work is carried on, and daily practiſed, then by <hi>cuſtom</hi> and <hi>habit</hi> (an acquired habit) then it is eaſie, then 'tis the great <hi>ſoul-ſolace</hi> and delight. <hi>David's habitual beavenly mindedneſs, was the rare product and iſſue of his meditation;</hi> he found it ſo, and therefore follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the faſter: Therefore this ought to be a grand <hi>intendment:</hi> A heavenly mindedneſs, <hi>when 'tis ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual,</hi> when it is <hi>corroborated,</hi> and of a young ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Plant</hi> is grown to be a <hi>Tree</hi> of ſtrength, and yet <hi>is growing more;</hi> this is a <hi>rare excellency,</hi> and <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſweet</hi> attainment; a <hi>heavenly minded man,</hi> how excellent is ſuch a one generally in all mens tyes?</p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:47560:125"/>
               <p>This makes a Chriſtian <hi>ſtill with God, have his way above, his converſation in Heaven, Pſal.</hi> 139.18. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>feed on Manna, fill with peace and joy, overflow and abound in ſingular fruitfulneſs towards others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of the <hi>abundance</hi> of heart-heavenlineſs the <hi>mouth ſpeaks,</hi> and the <hi>whole converſation</hi> ſhines in an exemplary walking.</p>
               <p>Therefore the heart muſt be meditating upon hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, that it ſtill may be <hi>framing and fixing bigher</hi> in habitual thinkings. Meditate thy ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>heavenly mindedneſs,</hi> that ſo bleſſed and glorious frame. To conclude this third Reaſon: Therefore the Scripture holds forth Meditation in ſeveral ſorts. 1. Daily doing it in courſe. 2. Then occaſional meditating as a ſuperaddition. 3. And that of eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, or ſhort and more ſudden darting up the thoughts to Heav'n, to come in as an <hi>Auxiliary</hi> &amp; <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,</hi> when the other Meditation, <hi>more ſolemn</hi> and ſet, cannot be uſed; Ejaculations may oft interpoſe in our courſe. This is a <hi>wedge</hi> may be driven in, <hi>enter the throng</hi> and crowd of occaſions; when matters lie before us as <hi>tough and knotty pieces of wood,</hi> when they will not give way to <hi>meditation at large,</hi> but <hi>hinder it,</hi> this wedge may and will ever enter, if we apply it, to <hi>keep up the conſtancy</hi> of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly mindedneſs.</p>

THE fourth and laſt ground to ſupport this weighty work of holy Meditation, is the conſideration of the <hi>great advantages</hi> or <hi>diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,</hi> ariſing from the careful performance, or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs neglect of it. Every Ordinance of Chriſt hath holy advantages attending it; thoſe who uſe them aright, daily experience how good it is to walk in the King of Heaven's high-ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt I ſhall name, is that ſo <hi>glorious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage</hi> of <hi>improving</hi> our communion and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unce with God, <hi>Job.</hi> 22.21. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. No com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion we <hi>can expect,</hi> much leſs can we improve it, <hi>out of the uſe</hi> of holy Ordinances, whereby we <hi>draw neer</hi> to God, and <hi>God to us:</hi> Although God himſelf be not ſo <hi>tyed to theſe ways,</hi> but he may come to us, when and how he pleaſeth; yet <hi>we are tyed to Gods Ordinances, as our ways of acquaintance with him;</hi> and when in a holy manner we draw neer to God, he hath promiſed to command the bleſſing to us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.5. <hi>He ſhall, &amp;c.</hi> Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being then his Ordinance, <hi>it is a way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> a ſingular way of acting our ſpirits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, of <hi>acting our minds</hi> and <hi>thoughts</hi> in a way of reference to him, either more directly or leſs; ſometimes Meditation is acted on his infinite <hi>excellencies,</hi> in ſeeing his <hi>infinite beauty</hi> and <hi>loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:47560:126"/>admiring</hi> and <hi>glorifying</hi> him; and by this Contemplation we come to an <hi>improvement</hi> of our knowledge, to underſtand more of him, an <hi>enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of affections, <hi>encouragement</hi> of our wills, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of him, and aimings at his glorifying and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting; <hi>excciting</hi> and <hi>ſtirring</hi> up the Graces of Faith, for ſtronger recumbencies on his All-ſufficiency, love to cleave more, humility to ſtoop and ſubmit more, patience to endure more willingly, and other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to act higher in their ſpheres and ranks; by all in the ways of exerciſing them, to own him and have him more to be our God. Meditation helps <hi>to move and carry the ſoul,</hi> and all that is of it and in it, towards God: And when we act upon him, <hi>open the doors of our hearts to him, Rev.</hi> 3.20. God he comes in and manifeſts himſelf in his Grace, Quicknings, Supportings, Comforts; he ſups with us, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. and we ſup with him, he is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and delighted with our Graces exerciſed towards him, and we ſup with him in his manifeſtations of himſelf to us, in his helpings of us, gladding and chearing our ſpirits, raviſhing our hearts with the taſtes of his love.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXX.</hi> Of ſolace and ſpiritual pleaſure, another end of Meditation.</head>
               <p n="2">2. AS it is a way of <hi>ſingular communion</hi> with God, ſo it is for <hi>a heavenly walk,</hi> of great ſoul-ſolace and delight; a <hi>path of pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> to walk, turn, and recreate thy ſpirit in; as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, Prov.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Her ways are ways of pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, all her ways;</hi> all the particular paths in thoſe ways, and therefore this way; and it is made <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely by Chriſt,</hi> for his people to <hi>walk and turn in:</hi> One of the <hi>ſtately large high walks</hi> in the King of Glories Garden, for thy walk and ſweet refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. <hi>Travelling abroad</hi> to ſee ſundry Countries, Towns, Cities, and the great varieties of Objects there, is counted a rare ſight, a great pleaſure and contentment.</p>
               <p>Travelling with the <hi>Eye of Reaſon,</hi> amongſt the great myſteries and <hi>rare ſecrets</hi> of Nature; and by ſearching, curious exquiſite ſearching, to make <hi>new, ſtrange diſcoveries</hi> of Natures <hi>implanted excellencies;</hi> the <hi>makings</hi> and framings ſo admirable, the <hi>proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and efficacies ſo ſtrange and amazing in ſo many ſorts of things. This travelling in theſe cloſe walks, theſe hidden ways ending in new, rare and uſeful experiences, is a very ſingular pleaſure to many, but peculiarly to <hi>elevated, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined parts and wits.</hi> But travelling with a <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual eye,</hi> among ſpiritual, holy, and heavenly Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:47560:127"/>and to ſee this whole proſpect, take a view of all the <hi>varieties of heavenly beauties and glories,</hi> meeting us in our walk; this is a <hi>raviſhing ſolace</hi> indeed, beyond all others, as far as Diamonds tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend the dirt, or the glorious lights of Heaven do clods of Earth or Dunghils.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.14, 15, 16. the Pſalmiſt tells what in Meditation-walks he met with, <hi>more ſolace than in all riches,</hi> of which he had ſo great abundance, a Kingdom of his own, and the rich ſpoils of other Kingdoms alſo.</p>
               <p>Carnal and ſenſual perſons, ſtudy ſometimes, and act <hi>great curioſity</hi> to <hi>heighten</hi> and <hi>enlarge</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and to <hi>find out new, rare pleaſures,</hi> not taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before: Oft they are at <hi>a loſs,</hi> and diſcompoſed, for a not having ſome new pleaſures, as being <hi>cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> with the old. But here is a way for a heavenly ſpirit, of unwearied walking, of <hi>ever taſting larger pleaſures:</hi> Of ever finding <hi>freſh and higher,</hi> more pure, more permanent pleaſures, ſuch pleaſures <hi>that enlarge the heart, and then enlarge themſelves in it;</hi> ſuch pleaſures that come fuller, freſher, ſweeter in, and then there fix and dwell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.11. Our Saviour tells us of a <hi>full joy,</hi> and <hi>of a remaining joy:</hi> who can tell you ſuch hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py tidings, where elſe <hi>any ſuch joy</hi> is to be both felt and fixt? But in ſuch ways where Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>water of life,</hi> ſprings forth and flows; the Saints meet with it, drink of it abundantly; <hi>meditate to drink, meditate and drink:</hi> They meditate, and in their walking meet with rare, rich things, ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſweet: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.34. <hi>David</hi> faith his <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God was ſweet;</hi> certainly it was ſo, and he means <hi>unſpeakably ſweet;</hi> meditation on the word
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:47560:127"/>and works of God, were abundantly ſweet, <hi>O how ſweet muſt meditation of God himſelf be?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Meditation <hi>brings</hi> in, and <hi>gives down</hi> ſweeter and more ſurpaſſing pleaſures, than all earthly carnal things can; ſo much beyond them, as <hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven is beyond baſeſt bread, meaneſt fare; <hi>as the Wine of Chriſt's miraculous making, beyond the water it was made of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three things eſpecially <hi>make pleaſures excellent.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. When the pleaſurable things are rich and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, as <hi>Nature yields</hi> them, as rare fruits, rich ſpices, and the like.</item>
                  <item>2. When they are rare and excellent, as <hi>Art redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> them, as <hi>Art meliorates</hi> and perfects them.</item>
                  <item>3. When they have a <hi>right and curious,</hi> an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite <hi>receiver,</hi> and <hi>perceiver:</hi> As when pureſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Waters are fetcht freſh, in a pure clean Veſſel, and have a curious Taſter: Or as the richeſt Grape, by the beſt art, is made into Wine, put into the beſt Cask, and hath beſt ordering, and then comes to an exquiſite Palate: Or ſome excellent Fleſh or Fiſh is by the beſt art prepared, and by the exquiſitely right and curious Taſter diſeerned.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Meditation it hath thoſe kinds of <hi>Objects,</hi> which in their own Nature are moſt tranſeendent, pureſt Springs and Rivers of Water of life, the things <hi>moſt ſoul-ſatiating,</hi> and unſpeakably delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the <hi>moſt glorious God,</hi> the <hi>unſearchable riches</hi> of Chriſt, the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> the great Helper and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, the <hi>pure and perfect Word,</hi> the <hi>precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, heavenly Ordinances,</hi> glorious <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>eternal happineſs.</hi> Theſe are in themſelves moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and therefore the higheſt ground for our Meditations walk, for ſolace, and pleaſure, and he higheſt.</p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:47560:128"/>
               <p n="2">2. They have the moſt <hi>excellent means of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> and fitting them for a <hi>right taſte;</hi> the Art and skill of the <hi>bleſſed Spirit,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.9. by his fitting them, and ordering them to the beſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs for us, both for our minds and hearts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings to know them, wills and affections to cloſe with them: They are made <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, perſwaſive</hi> and <hi>operative;</hi> they have a <hi>ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs conferr'd by an infinite wiſdom</hi> of a God that knows how beſt to deliver them, as he hath done it in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They have the beſt ways of <hi>receiving and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,</hi> namely the higheſt kind of wiſdom, a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and elevated</hi> underſtanding, with a <hi>ſtamp and rare principle</hi> of ſpiritual judgment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. and heavenly mindedneſs, diſcerning and ſavouring of ſpiritual things, in allowing and approving of them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.15. <hi>He that is ſpiritual diſcerneth, Phil.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Approve things that are excellent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Will and Affections they receive, and have the excellent principle of reliſhing, and ſavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpiritual things, in chuſing and complacency, in love and joy: <hi>O how I love thy Law, Pſal.</hi> 119.97. <hi>Thy Teſtimonies are the joy and rejoycing of my heart, Pſal.</hi> 119.111. This is from the principle of Grace, that gives in an <hi>ability of reliſhing</hi> the ſweet and ſavoury things of Heaven.</p>
               <p>But when <hi>all theſe concur,</hi> as it is in a <hi>holy heart,</hi> and in reference to it, the pleaſure is <hi>moſt ſurpaſſing,</hi> far beyond others, where the nature of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures is lower, the preparation lower, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver and faculty of taſting, of either outward or inward ſenſe, or of a meer natural and carnal heart, in its beſt wiſdom and moral excellencies, is far lower.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:47560:128"/>Meditation is the rare way to <hi>ſoul-ſolaces,</hi> and <hi>ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pleaſures,</hi> as <hi>bringing in the moſt excellent delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> and <hi>ſtirring</hi> up the holy heart to act its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the Mind, Will, and Affections, of taſting and reliſhing them, and ſo to have let in the ſweet plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and refreſhments of them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>rareſt hours,</hi> and <hi>richeſt ſoul Banquets</hi> have been prepared and come to, uſually by this way of Meditation: when the <hi>ſpirit goes up to Heaven by holy Contemplation, Heaven comes down to us by rich Conſolation.</hi> Heavenly comforts <hi>meet us balf way, fill us brim full,</hi> and <hi>ſometimes to ſuch runnings over, as we know not how to bear up under the glorious ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them:</hi> Never doth any <hi>ſenſualiſt</hi> or any <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> in his way, taſte of ſuch pleaſures; <hi>Prov.— Meddles not with Saints joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not <hi>poſſible</hi> that ſenſual and brutiſh pleaſures ſhould be ſuch <hi>as intellectual;</hi> nor intellectual in <hi>meerly ſinful ſpirits,</hi> ſuch as <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and heavenly Meditation, being <hi>a ſpiritual operation acts higher, returns the pureſt, higheſt and moſt raviſhing pleaſures.</hi> Let the Saints Experience give in evidence; and if ſinners try <hi>upon heart changing</hi> and elevating Grace, they then will find, that <hi>no ſenſual,</hi> nor any pleaſures of moſt <hi>raiſed Fancies,</hi> or <hi>higheſt notions</hi> can hold proportion with ſpiritual pleaſures let into the heart, and taſted from this Divine Meditation.</p>
               <p>There are many other high advantages I may add; as particularly,</p>
               <p n="1">1. As for <hi>brightening</hi> and clearing of knowledge, this was mentioned on a former occaſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Meditation ſerves for <hi>improving the judgment; the moſt judicious Chriſtians are ſuch as meditate moſt:</hi> Perſons of a <hi>ſhort ſpirit,</hi> whoſe thoughts are
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:47560:129"/>not full length, not well ſized, where thoughts touch as a perfect round thing, on a <hi>perfect plain;</hi> as <hi>lightening</hi> paſſes through the Air, and ſtays no time: Not like the Sun that not only ſhines but ſtays, that ſtaying of his light makes the beſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of things; ſo when things are ſtayed, and have fuller length of time; this is the way to be a judicious Chriſtian, to attain a <hi>ſpirit of judgment; the ſhorter you think, the ſhorter will you be of a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſneſs in the things of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Meditation <hi>keeps up</hi> and <hi>improves</hi> an awakened and tender conſcience, as bringing in more <hi>plenty of light,</hi> and <hi>acting it more</hi> upon the ſpirit, acting ſtronger reflections, deeper ſearchings, fuller diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries in reſpect of the frame of the ſpirit within, and the converſation without: They that ſtudy themſelves moſt, <hi>will be moſt awakened</hi> to greater ſenſibleneſs, care, and fear, and ſet the ſtrongeſt watches upon their deceitful hearts.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Meditation makes a Chriſtian <hi>keep up his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and livelineſs; the <hi>beſt actings are bottom'd on the heart, put beſt in frame by raiſed elevated, and moſt ſpiritualized thoughts:</hi> It is greatly conducing to greateſt growth; ſouls if we would have them fat and flouriſhing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. have the Garden of Graces, and the Beds of Spices flouriſh and flow forth, they muſt have as the other helps of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ordinances, ſo the hand of a conſtant Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to water them: he that beſt orders the firſt Wheel, the firſt Mover, will have all the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing move more regularly and exactly.</p>
               <p>The ſpiritual diſadvantages muſt needs be great where holy Meditation is neglected and never uſed, or but ſeldom, or ſlightly uſed. The advantages
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:47560:129"/>may be the rule of judging the diſadvantages; but I ſhall in particular mention ſome of the ſpiritual diſadvantages, and then come to the improvement of all that hath been ſaid.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt diſadvantage, and that is a <hi>prejudice</hi> to purpoſe a total neglect of Meditation, or an uſual doing it ſlightly and formally, not ſeriouſly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, is a great and principal ground of mens <hi>abiding</hi> in a ſtate of vanity, a living wholly to <hi>no purpoſe,</hi> but utterly beſides the <hi>grand end</hi> that man was made for, that ſupream end, the infinitely wiſe God, the maker of man, and thereby the <hi>total and abſolute proprietor</hi> in, and owner of his all, and that end of living to God, and glorifying him; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, I ſay, in a <hi>wholly miſſing</hi> his end and chief mark: For who can take aim at any mark, that <hi>eyes it not,</hi> or looks not <hi>earneſtly</hi> and <hi>evenly</hi> at it; that either looks quite another way, or looks with a regardleſs eye at the beſt? The bleſſed Apoſtle tells us, he lookt with another eye, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13. with an eye that lookt not off, or lookt eaſily; but the beſt mark had the beſt aim, he lookt for life.</p>
               <p>The Scripture calls a ſinner <hi>a vain man, Jam.</hi> 2.20. for his living beſides his main end, ever in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing <hi>miſſing</hi> that chief end; which riſes from being wanting in aiming right, and that want of aiming is for want of minding. Never can aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is an act of the Will (intending is an act of the Will, aiming is the intending of a mark) never can aiming be right, unleſs conſidering or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating be right, be due and earneſt, with even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and conſtancy: That heart which comes not to be reduced to minding its chief end, will miſs it ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly at laſt.</p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:47560:130"/>
               <p>The reaſon why there is ſo much vanity in the beſt, is partly, yea greatly upon this <hi>little minding,</hi> this ſlight, uneven, and ſeldom looking wiſhly and well at the main mark of God and happineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Diſadvantage,</hi> ſinful ſecurity, a <hi>ſleepy ſoul ſtate,</hi> and heart hardning, a ſinking and decaying in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, is grounded much upon diſuſe of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, eſpecially Meditation of review and ſelf-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. <hi>No man repented, every one ruſheth into his courſe:</hi> Not conſidering, bottoms both ſinners, and Saints ſecurity, and growings worſe.</p>
               <p>If faln aſleep, if falling and in a declining ſtate, awakening and recovery muſt be by <hi>ſelf-bethinking,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 9.47. No wiſe man but hath need of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent reviews, and weighings again over and over, of the beſt of his doings, much more of the Errata, the Errors of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Givings way to evil and vain thoughts, will follow your neglect of good thoughts.</p>
               <p>The mind will be ever buſie, if not in good, then in that is evil; giving way to vain thoughts is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous; men by giving way to vain thoughts provoke God to leave them, to give them up to a walking in the vanity of their minds, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.17. and at laſt as to a cuſtomary vanity of mind, God may give them up to judicial diſ-reliſhing, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring holy things, and the thinkings of them, and ſo periſh in them.</p>
               <p>O let therefore the good hand of my God, ſo ſtay up and act my weak and warping ſpirit, with the ſtrongeſt and moſt efficacious Reaſons and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in this ſo greatly important and neceſſary, ſo ſweet and bleſſed an Ordinance, this heavenly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:47560:130"/>that I may ever prove a better Artiſt in it, a better Chriſtian by it!</p>
               <p>Having now diſpatcht the reaſons and grounds of this ſo great and neceſſary Duty of <hi>Divine Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> with thoſe things which concern the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſeveral ways or ſorts of it; I muſt now come to the fourth and laſt propounded particular, namely the right improvement of the Doctrine or aſſertion of the neceſſity on all, to meditate upon <hi>heavenly</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual things,</hi> to exerciſe themſelves in this ſo <hi>concerning, advantageous,</hi> and <hi>bleſſed bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</hi>

               <p>THis being ſo <hi>concerning</hi> a work, and having ſo ſtrong an influence upon the <hi>whole courſe of Chriſtianity;</hi> let us now endeavour to <hi>beat out this Gold,</hi> extend it and make it appliable to the ſtate and condition of all ſorts of perſons, in all the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ways we can.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Inference.</hi> Then if Meditation on ſpiritual things, and earthly in a ſpiritual manner, in ſuch ſeriouſneſs, ſearchings, and dwellings of the thoughts upon them, for ſuch high and holy ends, is ſo needful for all Chriſtians to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſtruction</hi> 1. It ſerves then to hold forth <hi>a light of inſtruction</hi> to all that own the Lord Chriſt, the <hi>Golden Scepter of his Word,</hi> and the obligation laid ſo indiſpenſibly on them, to ſee how they are call'd upon to own and obſerve it, to tread and walk continually in this ſweet and pleaſant path, this ſo righteous and good way.</p>
               <p>Divers there are who call themſelves Chriſtians, and would be counted good, if not ſo good as any, which yet lead a life of inadvertency, and quite
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:47560:131"/>overlooking of it, mind not this Meditation; as if it concern'd them not, as if they were not at all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd, but free from any ſuch <hi>engagement</hi> of their thoughts, any employing of their ſerious thoughts this way.</p>
               <p>O how many are there to be found, that never conſidered what that <hi>noble eye</hi> of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was given for! they uſe it as if it were made to look <hi>only downward,</hi> or any other way but upward and heavenward; that loſe, contentedly loſe, the principal end of that ſo rare faculty, made moſt peculiarly to mind and contemplate heavenly beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and excellencies.</p>
               <p>What was ſaid by Duke <hi>Alva,</hi> he did not uſe to look up to Heaven, this may be ſaid of too many, yea they may ſay it of themſelves, they do not uſe to look up to Heaven, by meditating on the things above.

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> FOR humbling greatly every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, in that at the beſt and <hi>ſooneſt</hi> we began ſo late this ſeriouſneſs of thoughts, this Duty of Meditation, which challenges of all the very <hi>firſt conſideration</hi> and <hi>pondering;</hi> the very <hi>firſt buddings out,</hi> and firſt bloſſomings of the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power, ſhould begin with our ſpiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, not letting it act blindly, ignorantly, evilly, and impertinently, but knowingly, wiſely, and in a right manner; the rule allows not taking <hi>the firſt ſtep,</hi> nor <hi>any other</hi> after wrong. Ah how long hath it been, how long have the beſt of Saints, the ſooneſt bloſſoming and ripen'd young Chriſtians, how long was it before <hi>conſideration</hi> and <hi>meditation</hi> began in their hearts, before the Scepter of Jeſus Chriſt, held forth in the Laws and Commands of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:47560:135"/>Meditation, was attended, would be yielded to? How long e're that any of our fond and froward ſpirits would ceaſe their vanities and wildneſs, follies and impertinencies of thoughts? When wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in any one begins to act, then conſideration begins; no hopes of young heads, till they begin to put forth and act conſideration, then begin they to be wiſe, or give hopes of a being hereafter wiſe, when they prove conſiderate; then begins that which is wiſdom <hi>for thy ſelf,</hi> when thou comeſt to conſider, when thy ſpirit begins to <hi>beat the Golden path of Meditation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ah then let it humble us, it was ſo long before the firſt and <hi>fundamental Meditation</hi> or Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before that <hi>firſt engaging</hi> the heart to ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and a due minding, that <hi>initial</hi> and <hi>introductive</hi> conſidering for true turning to God with the whole heart.</p>
               <p>Formerly in one of the grounds of this point we mentioned the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of conſideration, and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering our unſpeakable miſery by ſin and God's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, in <hi>order to converſion to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As all <hi>that are truly converted are truly humbled,</hi> ſo all truly <hi>humbled</hi> and <hi>converted</hi> are made firſt tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerious and ſelf-bethinking, reduced to this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of their <hi>inexpreſſibly</hi> miſerable condition.</p>
               <p>Converſion to God ſtands as it were on two feet, comes about by a double inlet, of a twofold Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration or Meditation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A ſerious Meditation of now ſeen and felt unſpeakable miſery, that load and burden of ſin and Gods wrath laid on, and this muſt be deep, <hi>ſink</hi> down into the ſoul and preſs it, and <hi>ſoak</hi> through the ſoul, in <hi>ſorrowings,</hi> in <hi>meltings,</hi> in <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:47560:135"/>of ſpirit, and in <hi>willingneſs</hi> to be eaſed of the preſent preſſure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then a moſt ſerious Meditation and <hi>Ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the rich free grace of God</hi> the Father, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable in a full Saviour, offer'd in a free firm Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Promiſe of ſalvation, to every ſinner without exception.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>two great conſiderations</hi> are the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and <hi>inlets</hi> of the <hi>great heart-mutation and converſion:</hi> Therefore theſe are of the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of all other <hi>conſiderations;</hi> yea theſe are ſuch conſiderations, that no other <hi>are to be reckon'd upon,</hi> till they have been performed effectually.</p>
               <p>Ah therefore how exceedingly ſhould this hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all perſons whatſoever, for their former ſo long neglect of this <hi>introductive</hi> and <hi>fundamental conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: Hoſ.</hi> 8.5.

               <p>Ah what an <hi>humbling charge</hi> ſhould this bring up to every ſpirit, to every boſom! O how ſhould it <hi>ſhame</hi> thee and me, and every one, to think how long it was before we began <hi>to do that might be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thinking,</hi> before I <hi>once began</hi> to think to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, how long my <hi>thinking and conſidering power</hi> was meerly <hi>abuſed</hi> by me, was both <hi>diverted</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed</hi> by a continual <hi>running</hi> like Water beſide the Mill, <hi>ravelling</hi> out like a <hi>golden Thread,</hi> ſpoil'd as faſt as ſpun, by a neglect of winding up and right

               <p>Some-Diſeaſes in that ſo noble part the head, are moſt dangerous, the Cure is hard, the Killing quick; when vanity ſeizes the mind, when men from vain thoughts ariſing in them, come to <hi>allowing</hi> of them, and from <hi>allowing</hi> to a <hi>walking</hi> in the vanity of their minds, vanity of thoughts <hi>becomes</hi> an habit, and when it becomes habitual, then the danger is high: All <hi>habits,</hi> evil habits, are like <hi>old rooted Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,</hi> hardly, if ever, cured; O when men walk in the vanity of their minds, <hi>God may be provoked</hi> to a giving them up to walk on, and ſo be at laſt

                  <item>1. To fail ſo frequently in that ſo needful daily Meditation, do it ſo little or ſo ſlenderly.</item>
                  <item>2. To take <hi>ſo ſeldom</hi> into that path of <hi>Occaſional ſet</hi> and <hi>ſolemn</hi> Meditation, that alſo of <hi>ſo great</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, <hi>large incomes</hi> of light and wiſdom, warmth and quickening, ſtrength and encouragings.</item>

And to act no oftner that ſo <hi>eaſie, quick,</hi> and expedite <hi>ejaculatory meditating,</hi> whereby thy ſoul may give incumbrances and overcharging buſineſs <hi>the ſlip,</hi> take breath, eaſe it ſelf, mount up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>make a ſhort viſit,</hi> and return refreſht, quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and enlarged.</item>
               </list>
               <p>A Student never does himſelf <hi>ſuch wrong,</hi> as when he reads much and muſes little, for then he either <hi>receives</hi> in, or retains nothing; or cannot <hi>manage</hi> his Notions: <hi>We never order and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch Affairs worſe than when we Meditate leaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo a Chriſtian never loſes more labour, does his <hi>ſoul-affairs worſe,</hi> than when he <hi>muſes not,</hi> and <hi>warms</hi> not himſelf by this exerciſe of Meditation. Divers profeſs a faculty and ability, as in Sciences and ways of Learning, in Myſteries and ways of Trading and Dealing, yet are but <hi>ſlender proficients,</hi> can do little but bungle, becauſe they <hi>ſtudy and muſe no more</hi> to know their own way.</p>
               <p>Many Chriſtians are <hi>but bunglers,</hi> to what they

               <p>Serious thinking is <hi>fundamental</hi> to all right do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; O what are the innumerable advantages that thy conſtancy in this courſe would ſtill bring in? and what have been thy loſſes by neglect, and will daily increaſe upon thee by it? Ah therefore conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>be awakened</hi> and ſtrive to be humbled for all thy failings and neglects; <hi>eſpecially thy fallings off from,</hi> and diſuſings of this ſo neceſſary and excellent Duty; look to thy <hi>firſt</hi> beginning in it, and thy making no better entrance into it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> A perſwaſion to all ſuch who never accuſtomed themſelves to this work of Meditation.</head>
               <p>IF Meditation be <hi>ſo neceſſary</hi> a Duty, let this then <hi>prevail</hi> with every one that hitherto hath done nothing in it as yet, or that which hath been to no purpoſe. O that this ſin can be laid to <hi>thy ſouls charge,</hi> that yet thou art to begin to meditate of the great things of thy God, and thy own ſoul. That thou ſhouldeſt have <hi>ſo rare a power</hi> in thy ſoul, of thinking and meditating, a power alſo that is ſo <hi>active</hi> and <hi>buſie continually,</hi> and yet never employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aright; ſo <hi>great a Talent</hi> entruſted for uſe, and either <hi>hid up</hi> in a Napkin, or waſted and <hi>ravelled out</hi> in vanities, impertinencies, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Seriouſly, I beſeech thee, conſider, thou canſt be no <hi>good Chriſtian,</hi> no <hi>truly godly perſon</hi> (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou or others think of thee) that haſt been, and art no complier, but a refuſer in this particular. Ah, this ſtrikes thee home to the heart, daſhes quite thy confidence and hopes, grounded on thy calling thy ſelf a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>That clear paſſage <hi>proves it undeniably, Pſal.</hi> 1.2. <hi>The bleſſed man meditates in the Law of God day and night:</hi> The leaſt that this place can hold forth, muſt
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:47560:145"/>be a <hi>doing this duty in a courſe and way;</hi> he that is a bleſſed man, is not only one that pretends to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but practiſeth and <hi>uſes Meditation,</hi> hath an <hi>inward delight in the Law of God, and from delight in it, meditates on it,</hi> in a conſtancy and ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; not <hi>acts a now and then bare thinking,</hi> when others mention it, Miniſters preach on it, or in the reading of it; to <hi>think of it then</hi> when it cannot <hi>well be avoided;</hi> but a ſerious and purpoſely meditat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a keeping up a <hi>conſcientious</hi> and complacent conſtancy in it.</p>
               <p>If therefore <hi>continual Meditation</hi> of the Law of God, his Word, and the Excellencies in it, be the character of a godly perſon, <hi>think well of it</hi> and thy own condition; <hi>flatter not thy ſelf</hi> with that kind of falſe godlineſs, which <hi>falls ſhort</hi> of the true character <hi>of true bleſſedneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider thou canſt be no <hi>true ſubject of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that doeſt not ſubmit to this <hi>Law of Chriſt,</hi> this <hi>Meditation:</hi> It is in Scripture made one of the <hi>imperial Laws</hi> of the King of the Church, who gives every ſubject of his this charge, lays this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>indiſpenſibly,</hi> and <hi>repeats</hi> it frequently, <hi>records</hi> the examples of the Saints, who practiſed it dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, as <hi>David</hi> and others; therefore thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owneſt this Law, thou diſowneſt the Law-giver Chriſt, and ſo he takes it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Ah then <hi>what is it that reigns</hi> in thy heart, that <hi>ſits</hi> in the throne and ſways, but the Tyrant ſin, <hi>ſin that hath dominion over thee,</hi> ſin that is the great <hi>obſtruction</hi> and hinders thee, ſin that is the great <hi>Biaſs of diverſion</hi> that draws thee quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way?</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is meerly <hi>the vanity</hi> of thy mind, in which
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:47560:146"/>thou walkeſt, that keeps thee from walking this way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is thy <hi>ſinful folly;</hi> the <hi>wiſe</hi> in heart will muſe and conſider, and <hi>moſt conſider</hi> things of the moſt concernment, what is it which hath made all the <hi>ſpiritual fools,</hi> but ſin? The <hi>Scripture fool</hi> is the ſinner, and wherein is the folly ſeen more, than in <hi>not conſidering</hi> things moſt conſiderable?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thy not meditating, it is from the <hi>tydes and currents</hi> of unmortified luſts; luſts in dominion and reign, luſts that <hi>ingroſs</hi> thy thinkings, luſts that <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage</hi> and ſet thy thoughts on work, and intend them.</p>
               <p>In every <hi>predominant luſt</hi> there is a predominant <hi>ſcope</hi> and tendency, an <hi>end and aim</hi> that gives the rules and laws; as therefore the luſts aim lies, ſo all the thoughts and ſeriouſneſs are levell'd; as the luſt-aims and marks are, ſo are the mindings: If luſts of ſenſuality, riot, drunkenneſs, uncleanneſs, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs; if theſe or any of theſe be predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, all the ſtrength of the mind and its muſings run out at that leak, that paſſage.</p>
               <p>If <hi>covetouſneſs</hi> and worldly mindedneſs be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, all the ſtudyings and thinkings run down, and are carried away by that outlet.</p>
               <p>If <hi>pride, vain-glory,</hi> and affectation of honour bear ſway, then the <hi>thoughts and contrivances</hi> act up all that way, climb up that Hill.</p>
               <p>Thy <hi>ſerving luſts and pleaſures,</hi> being inſlaved by them, is the ground of thy thoughts ſubſerviency to them; they ſet up <hi>an excluſive</hi> of good thoughts, ſhut the door againſt all godly ſeriouſneſs, turn the Engine of the thinking power into an <hi>inſtrument</hi> and forge, for themſelves to act a ſinful ſeriouſneſs,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:47560:146"/>to farther only the ſatisfying of them.</p>
               <p>I have <hi>read in Pliny,</hi> that the Romans attempting a diſcovery of ſome more unknown places of <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> could not <hi>proceed</hi> and ſucceed in it by reaſon of the innumerable ſorts <hi>of Serpents and poyſonous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> which filled the Country. Thy heart is like that Country, full of dangerous luſts, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run it; there is the true reaſon why thou wilt not, canſt not meditate, becauſe the predominant luſts in it engroſs and enſlave the whole thinking power, luſts rule thy lookings, thy hearts ſinfulneſs hath ſeiſed thy ſeriouſneſs, <hi>ſweeps all thoughts in to it ſelf and ſervice.</hi> One luſt <hi>ſhares now one proportion of thoughts,</hi> another luſt goes away <hi>with another part,</hi> and ſo among them all, who take <hi>their turns in thy heart,</hi> they gather up, and <hi>appropriate all thy ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>vigour of thoughts,</hi> all that are to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; all other <hi>thinkings</hi> are ſo ſhort, ſlight, ſeldom acted in compariſon, that they amount to nothing, millions of them make no more than motes in the Sun would contribute to make a Mountain, becauſe there's commonly nothing of ſeriouſneſs in them; when they are acted toward things ſpiritual, they are but ſmoke or chaff that flies away: And conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der why luſts have thy thoughts ſo enſlaved to them, it is becauſe luſts and ſin have that Empreſs of thy heart, thy love; for as thy love is, ſo are thy think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; thou pretendeſt thou loveſt God, and with all thy heart, but 'tis no ſuch thing; that which hath the <hi>love moſt,</hi> hath the <hi>eye moſt, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi amor, ibi oculus,</hi> as the common ſaying is; who ever could truly ſay <hi>they loved any perſon moſt,</hi> and thought of <hi>that perſon leaſt,</hi> but of <hi>other things every day and hour more?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:47560:147"/>
               <p>O conſider this well, how <hi>evil it is</hi> thou medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateſt not by reaſon of thy <hi>reigning corruptions</hi> and luſts that will not let thee meditate; and luſts <hi>have thy thoughts</hi> from <hi>having thy love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Why as to thy own frame of ſpirit is there a neglect of this holy Duty? it is from <hi>ſin reigning</hi> in the reliſhing part, the palate of thy ſoul; ſin that <hi>takes away thy taſte,</hi> and makes godlineſs unſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: <hi>Thoſe that are after the fleſh, ſavour the things of the fleſh, Rom.</hi> 8.5. Ah, not to meditate from ſuch a <hi>ſad cauſe,</hi> from a <hi>not ſavouring</hi> the things of God! finding no ſutableneſs, no ſweetneſs, no pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſpiritual things! none in the Word and ways of God, in the precious promiſes, heavenly graces, glorious priviledges, given to the Children of God! none in an infinitely ſweet and bleſſed God, Father, Son, and Spirit! none in the things above, but all in the things below, not becauſe they have no ſavour or ſweetneſs in them, but becauſe thy carnal heart <hi>hath no principle of ſavouring of them!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Nay is it not from ſin that lodges and breeds in thy boſom a helliſh enmity againſt any thing is holy? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The carnal mind is enmity to God,</hi> and ſo againſt every thing that comes from God. Ah but ſinner, this is the <hi>blackeſt thing</hi> in thine or any boſom, this is the <hi>loathſomeſt thing</hi> in all the world, 'tis the <hi>chief feature</hi> and lineament in the <hi>face of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> the moſt <hi>abominable part</hi> of Satans heart, and the very worſt thing in all Hell; nothing is, or will be <hi>more evil in Hell,</hi> than their <hi>enmity,</hi> boiling up, and running over continually againſt God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But who is he that hath <hi>unhinged thy heart,</hi> in reſpect of this Duty of Meditation, that acts thee to this awkneſs, and bars the door againſt it? is it
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:47560:147"/>not <hi>Satan</hi> that dwells and rules within? Satan that is thy ſouls <hi>implacable</hi> Enemy, and the great adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to this Meditation? And what is his reaſon of hindering thee, his grand reaſon, but that he knows this to be the way of <hi>coming</hi> to a mans ſelf, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting to God?</p>
               <p>Of all ſuch things that are <hi>diſpoſitive</hi> and aſſiſting to Converſion and Faith, Satan is the <hi>grand enemy</hi> to this conſideration and meditating of a mans ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual condition; if thou wilt do <hi>Satans will,</hi> and gratifie him the beſt thou canſt, if thou wilt give him the <hi>beſt ſecurity</hi> of utter undoing thy ſelf, let him ſee and know thou wilt not conſider and <hi>muſe on</hi> thy ſouls concerns, but look quite another way.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Whither do thy thoughts <hi>ſink and ſoak,</hi> but into the baſe Earth, and in the baſe things of it; he that looks with his <hi>bodily eye,</hi> if he looks not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, may look many other ways than downward, right forward, on the right, or left hand; but thy ſoul's eye, if it look not to things above, it looks <hi>downward</hi> to the things below, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. the <hi>baſe dry earth</hi> drinks up all thy thoughts.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When wilt thou <hi>begin to think,</hi> to think to any <hi>purpoſe indeed,</hi> when will that time be? ſhall it be when thou art moſt <hi>timeleſs</hi> and <hi>heartleſs?</hi> when thou haſt <hi>leaſt leiſure, leaſt fitneſs,</hi> bodily fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſpoſition, of eaſe, ſtrength, ſpirits, and ſenſes? when thou haſt leaſt heart-fitneſs, of deſires and willingneſs, which with time will wear away and be leſs?</p>
               <p>The longer thou <hi>diſuſeſt thy ſelf</hi> to good and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious thinkings, the leſs fit and diſpoſed thou wilt every way be, and the more will <hi>vanity of thoughts</hi>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:47560:148"/>grow upon thee, <hi>dye thy mind</hi> into the <hi>grain Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of habitual vanity;</hi> the <hi>more</hi> will <hi>thy heart</hi> grow up and <hi>ripen</hi> in an averſneſs from all <hi>good thoughts, harden</hi> and grow more <hi>ſinfully</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately</hi> ſet againſt ſeriouſneſs, all ſuch <hi>meditating</hi> as is neceſſary to true repenting.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Wilt thou defer <hi>thinking</hi> and <hi>conſidering</hi> till it be too late, till <hi>time</hi> and the <hi>ſeaſon</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> ſhall be no longer, till life, and ſoul, and Heaven be irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably loft? Wilt thou loſe this ſhort time here, till thou comeſt to an <hi>Eternity of time,</hi> to <hi>think of thy neglects of thinking?</hi> to muſe when it will do no good, when muſing on thy <hi>not muſing</hi> and <hi>meditat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> will turn <hi>into torturing and tormenting thee for ever?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ah, therefore now <hi>while it is call'd to day,</hi> now while <hi>thinking may do thee good,</hi> good to convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſaving; ah now <hi>bemoan thy ſelf,</hi> and ſad, ſo ſad, dreadful, and dangerous ſtate; never reſt or be quiet till thou becomeſt a <hi>ſerious perſon,</hi> one that uſeth his <hi>thinking power</hi> to the right end, and in the right manner, to <hi>meditate thy ſelf home,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal did home to his Fathers houſe, to be received with great joy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider therefore, this is one part of <hi>wiſdom indeed,</hi> of wiſdom for thy ſelf, when thy <hi>ſoul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns</hi> have their allowance of due conſideration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Never expect a <hi>cure of that worm,</hi> that <hi>Wolf in thy breaſt,</hi> of thoſe <hi>gnawing, grinding pains,</hi> and terrours of conſcience, until thou by conſideration come to convert and turn to God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Never wilt thou taſte <hi>of peace of conſcience,</hi> joy that is <hi>unſpeakable</hi> and <hi>full of glory,</hi> until thy <hi>thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanity</hi> be healed, and thou becomeſt a ſeriouſly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating perſon.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Therefore begin at that firſt Meditation of thy unſpeakable miſery under ſin, Gods wrath for it, death eternal awaiting thee, and which by deaths ſoon coming may ſeize thee, and ſeal thee up in it for ever.</p>

               <p>As there is <hi>nothing harder</hi> than to <hi>hedge</hi> in the thoughts and govern them, ſo how hard is it to make them <hi>keep and beat this path of Meditation,</hi> to have the ſoul go, as with Hinds feet, moſt readily and with enlargements of ſteps in it? <hi>The holieſt heart is too apt to flag and be weary, in the beſt path<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Meditation hath a <hi>ſtrong and active</hi> Enemy in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry boſom; when any would do this good, evil is preſent, in <hi>backwardneſs</hi> to it, <hi>regret and reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey</hi> riſes up, puts in <hi>a caveat, hangs a weight</hi> and clog to hinder, which <hi>watchfulneſs</hi> and reſolution muſt
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:47560:149"/>ſpy out and caſt off: <hi>Caſt off every weight,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. Every weight the fleſh caſts upon a Duty, the ſpirit muſt <hi>caſt off, and then run;</hi> ſin at all times can <hi>eaſily beſet us,</hi> and now at this time we may eaſily find it.</p>
               <p>How eaſily will ſin <hi>beſet us with excuſes?</hi> how eaſily with <hi>whole Troops</hi> of Arguments will it charge us? how eaſily with <hi>ſwarms of diverſione,</hi> diverting thoughts, purpoſes, affections, will it ſeek to warp us? this thing, and the other, and a third, and a thouſand, that flye about as <hi>thick in the heart,</hi> as motes in the Sun-ſhine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Meditation is harder than ſome other Duties of godlineſs; for in <hi>other Duties</hi> the <hi>body comes</hi> in, as an aſſiſtant to the ſoul, and lends a hand of help: As in praying, there may the voice come in, which is a great furtherance, <hi>keeping better</hi> up the minds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and keeping <hi>better off</hi> deadneſs and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: In reading, the <hi>eye is exerciſed,</hi> and the mind is the better, as to attention and heeding, if not to heat and intention: <hi>The eye affects the heart;</hi> ſo preaching hath the <hi>ear</hi> to convey and make the <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter impreſſion:</hi> But in Meditation, the ſoul acts <hi>ſingle</hi> and unaſſiſted, without a <hi>ſtirring up,</hi> or <hi>exciting</hi> by any ſenſe, or any help from the body, and ſo it is the harder, as the condition of our Nature now makes it: In the ſtate of imperfection, we need the bodies help to farther the ſoul in its workings in ſome ſort.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Meditation hath <hi>leaſt opportunities</hi> of coming under <hi>obſervation</hi> of others, and thereby <hi>leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> and encouragement for doing well, by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bad or good, before whom, in other caſes, our <hi>light ſhould ſhine, and God by them be glorified.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:47560:150"/>
               <p n="3">3. Meditation is hard, in that it is an <hi>acting of the quickeſt faculty,</hi> and the <hi>moſt ſlippery piece</hi> of the ſoul; nothing is nimbler than the thinking power, no act in the world <hi>quicker,</hi> and of more expedite motion than that of a thought, and nothing ſooner <hi>ſlips off</hi> the object, or thing acted upon, and makes a way faſter to a new, than the thinking faculty; like the <hi>Bird</hi> put wild into a Cage, the door is no ſooner open, but ſhe is gone.</p>
               <p>Meditation is harder, being not <hi>bare thinking,</hi> a <hi>flaſh,</hi> a ſit for an inſtant, a <hi>touching;</hi> but a fixing and ſtay of thoughts, a detaining them, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe are as Oyl in a mans right hand, that will not be retain'd: A carnal heart counts all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſpiritual engagements, <hi>but coming into bonds,</hi> tyings with Cords, longs to break them and be free, ſo doth it by this Cord and tye of Meditation; it's harſh work to the fleſh.</p>
               <p>O it's a <hi>moſt high attainment,</hi> to be able to ſay, <hi>O God my heart is fixed, Pſal.</hi> 108.1. fixed as to the purpoſe of heart, the choice and intent of the will, ſo to have the head, the mind, <hi>to ceaſe the rowling,</hi> ranging vanity and ſlipperineſs, and to act fixedly in the way of ſeriouſneſs, not be a <hi>light-headed,</hi> but a muſing man, a <hi>perſon of ponderings,</hi> and <hi>thought-ſtayings;</hi> like the <hi>Bee</hi> that lights on the Flower, and ſtays to have the Honey with her e're ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Meditation <hi>is the harder,</hi> in that <hi>Satan</hi> hath greater power upon, and more <hi>immediate paſſage</hi> to the faculty of imagination, than other faculties of the will and affections; he <hi>works not ſo immediately</hi> on the will and affections, as upon the imagination, and there he endeavours <hi>interruptions</hi> by his injecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:47560:150"/>and ſuggeſtions; there he <hi>endeavours diverſions</hi> to think <hi>quite another way</hi> from the work in hand, and diſturbances, caſting in <hi>by-thoughts,</hi> and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry objects of different or contrary nature to the duty we are in.</p>
               <p>As Satan <hi>fill'd Ananias heart,</hi> but firſt by filling the <hi>imagination</hi> with thought of covetouſneſs; ſo he can <hi>caſt ſuddenly into the beſt heart</hi> thoughts and apprehenſions, when about the beſt work, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb and hinder.</p>
               <p>Beſides, conſider his <hi>malice is great</hi> againſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, knowing how <hi>great advantage</hi> comes to us by it, and how much diſadvantage to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Satan is much prejudiced by ponderings;</hi> he ever <hi>watches</hi> when this work is taking in hand, and therefore Chriſtian, thou haſt greater reaſon of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the greater heed; to <hi>watch him</hi> that ſo watches thee, to <hi>fight him</hi> that fights againſt thee, and ſo envies thee the help of this Ordinance, that would not have thee enjoy the freedom of <hi>one good, one ſerious thought,</hi> but is caſting the duſt of <hi>evil thoughts</hi> in the eyes of our minds, when <hi>they are looking up</hi> to Heaven, but <hi>principally</hi> he envies and oppoſes <hi>ſeriouſneſs,</hi> ſearchings and dwelling of thoughts upon ſpiritual things.</p>
               <p>Satan deals with us here, as <hi>deceitful Courtiers</hi> and Councellors have done with their Maſters, <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting</hi> them from minding their affairs, and all <hi>right ſeriouſneſs,</hi> by pleaſures, and new devices, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of <hi>freedom from incumbrances,</hi> and trouble and enjoying themſelves; but that hereby <hi>they might</hi> more ſecurely proſecute &amp; compaſs their own private intereſts. Satan had rather we ſhould do any thing than keep up a <hi>ſeriouſneſs in Meditation</hi>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:47560:151"/>(or any other holy Duties) which may keep us awake and in a watchful poſture, againſt his enterpriſes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Meditation is the harder, <hi>by reaſon of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary mindleſneſs</hi> of ſo many, we daily meet and converſe with, who <hi>refuſe</hi> and ſlight <hi>all ſeriouſneſs,</hi> as <hi>unneceſſary niceneſs,</hi> or neglect it, <hi>out of ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,</hi> and <hi>lothneſs</hi> to trouble themſelves.</p>
               <p>Bad Examples are <hi>very infectious,</hi> apt to convey a <hi>ſecret</hi> poyſon into mens hearts, when they heed them not; by touching <hi>this pitch,</hi> the beſt are ready to be defiled.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Meditation is like the road or paſſage, where many things meet us, juſtle us, and are ready to turn us out of the way; cares they ſtrive to come in, buſineſſes and multiplicity of affairs, ſudden emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, and ſundry things, that may attempt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe; and theſe, if our watch and guard be not the ſtronger and ſtricter, will miſcarry the Duty.</p>
               <p>Yea ſometimes <hi>one Duty may drive out another;</hi> often we <hi>let holy duties interfere, and croſs each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> hearing, praying, and the reſt, ſometimes there's <hi>haſtening from one</hi> to another, <hi>ſometimes let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one detain us ſo long,</hi> that others are cut ſhort, and ſo helps are turned <hi>in part</hi> into hindrances, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities for ſome Duties <hi>into obſtructions</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when <hi>godly prudence</hi> allows every thing its ſeaſon and due proportion of time.</p>
               <p>The <hi>external hindrances</hi> to Meditation are many from common buſineſs, and things of this life; and we often <hi>create our own hindrances</hi> by our <hi>ſloth</hi> and imprudence, not carefully redeeming and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordering our times and opportunities.</p>
               <p>Ah then my ſoul, if Meditation be ſo high, ſo hard, as to its ſpiritual nature, and hath withal ſuch
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:47560:151"/>Enemies and oppoſitions, look to it then I muſt <hi>the more cautiouſly, but not leſs reſolutely perform it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Moraliſts ſay, that <hi>difficulty</hi> is <hi>cos virtutis,</hi> the <hi>incentive</hi> and heightener of magnanimity; to a <hi>great and heroick ſpirit</hi> nothing muſt be ſo great as to <hi>outlook it</hi> and diſcourage it: The greater and <hi>braver fiſh</hi> ſwim againſt the ſtream; <hi>the noble Chriſtian by difficulty and oppoſition is caution'd, but not cowed out.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the <hi>Evidences</hi> of a due Meditation.</head>
               <p>FOr the Evidences of a due and right Meditation, it muſt have the <hi>Nature, Properties,</hi> and <hi>Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants</hi> of it; and therefore it is not to be <hi>taken up as a cuſtom,</hi> as a thing <hi>made to ſtop the mouth of a calling and urging conſcience,</hi> or a meer <hi>acting for Notions,</hi> a
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:47560:155"/>ſtudy and ſearch <hi>of Curioſity,</hi> to know Novelty, or to know much, and be able to hold diſcourſe with others.</p>
               <p>But it muſt have a higher nature, <hi>purer ends,</hi> and <hi>be performed in another ſort,</hi> then an only wiſe or a learned man, yea then any formal Chriſtian can act or compaſs of himſelf.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>the Characters</hi> of a right holy Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there will be no need to fetch any other lights of diſcovery, <hi>but only to take up</hi> and hold thoſe to this intendment, which were opened in the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the nature of divine Meditation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As making it <hi>our real and high obedience to</hi> God, the <hi>ſoveraign Lord</hi> of our ſouls, <hi>and to the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Scepter of his Word</hi> in that expreſs Law of his, laid upon the thinking power, and grounded upon the high and infinite obligations he hath on us, to impoſe this thought-tribute, and homage, a pure obedience to him, and doing his will herein.</p>
               <p>He that meditates aright, hath been taught and learnt to obey God, to yield it to him as his due. <hi>I am under my God,</hi> ſaith the right Chriſtian, <hi>and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely obliged to all which he commands me.</hi> This among others, is one of his righteous and holy Laws, one great ſignification of his Royal will; I muſt not, will not deny it, diſpute it, or put it from me, but comply freely with it.</p>
               <p>And this comes from <hi>that ſpring, that root</hi> which lyes at the bottom of the heart, that <hi>ſupereminent love</hi> to God (the holy hearts chief good) and the great ground of all right obedience.</p>
               <p>Rom. 13.10. <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> and ſo is it <hi>the fulfilling of this particular Law of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meditation,</hi> love to God, ſo infinitely excellent in
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:47560:156"/>himſelf, and who hath ſo unſpeakably loved the holy ſoul.</p>
               <p>Therefore if it be the right and <hi>genuine obedience,</hi> it hath this high, <hi>this warm ſpring of love</hi> running in this channel, this of Meditation, an over-powering conſtraining love that breeds this thinking, this looking of the ſoul in Meditation.</p>
               <p>O therefore try if this <hi>heavenly love</hi> hath firſt been planted in the ſoil of thy heart, if <hi>from a new</hi> heart <hi>circumciſed to love the Lord</hi> above all; that thence thou comeſt to love Meditation, becauſe thou loveſt the Law-giver firſt, who <hi>writes his Law,</hi> and writes this particular Law in thy heart by love to it, <hi>by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thee</hi> a lover of Meditation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Meditation be <hi>genuine and right,</hi> then is it from a <hi>choice of will,</hi> wrought up by the power of <hi>holy love ſubduing and mortifying</hi> carnal and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly predominant unwillingneſs and ſtubbornneſs, reluctancy and refuſals of this work, and framing it <hi>to willingneſs, freeneſs,</hi> and fixedneſs of purpoſe to do it, and hold it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.48. <hi>I will meditate,</hi> ſaith <hi>the holy Pſalmiſt;</hi> Meditation aroſe from reſolution, from <hi>a will fixed,</hi> and that aroſe from <hi>love acted,</hi> and working the will to reſolution. Therefore in the 97. verſe of this Pſalm, he ſpeaks it to God himſelf, <hi>O how love I thy law!</hi> and what fruit doth this noble root of love put forth? it is <hi>my meditation all the day:</hi> Meditation of the Law proceeds from love to the Law.</p>
               <p>Love <hi>lay at the bottom,</hi> and that engaged the will into a firm reſolution to meditate. Never is the will freer, and its purpoſe firmer, then when love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines and engages it. The <hi>higheſt and ſtrongeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions</hi> that ever were taken up by any holy heart,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:47560:156"/>were the rare <hi>products and ſweet fruits</hi> of heavenly love, love efficaciouſly exciting the will, winding it up to the top, and then fixing it faſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Where the work of Meditation is right, <hi>the aims and ends of it are pure, ſpiritual, and holy,</hi> it is carried beyond and above ſelf; it is an acting <hi>with ſelf-denying:</hi> ſelf is neither <hi>the total,</hi> nor the predominant ingredient in this undertaking.</p>
               <p>That which Chriſt calls for, <hi>of denying a mans ſelf, Mark</hi> 8.34. in the <hi>extent</hi> of all Chriſtianity, <hi>muſt particularly be performed</hi> in this duty.</p>
               <p>Self-<hi>ſeeking</hi> muſt not be uppermoſt, not the main intent or inducement: For this is the Sphere an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound heart moves ever in.</p>
               <p>The aim and end <hi>in the beſt natural man</hi> is never <hi>higher then ſelf,</hi> and no other really then ſelf, and that becauſe he chiefly loves himſelf.</p>
               <p>But a right work muſt be aimed and acted above all <hi>to the living God.</hi> Therefore <hi>Zec.</hi> 7.5. God tells them their faſting was not right, becauſe they did it not to God; ſo is Meditation, or any other duty not right, if it be <hi>not to him, aimed above all at his Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this reſpect therefore, Religion is in Scripture called <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> becauſe it is a frame of ſpirit acting above all ſelf-ends and inferior reſpects, unto the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God above all.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. To ſerve the living God; works not done to the living God, are dead works; a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving work is aimed and level'd to the living God.</p>
               <p>The end more particularly muſt be <hi>the glorifying</hi> God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Do all to the glory of God.</hi> If eating, drinking, and ſuch inferior things, then much more holy duties muſt be done to Gods glory.</p>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:47560:157"/>
               <p>There muſt be an <hi>inward powerful principle</hi> that can aim ſo highly, really, and an acting of that principle that God is actually glorified.</p>
               <p>It is not <hi>enough</hi> to <hi>ſay we do,</hi> as many erringly affirm, they aim their duties, when they never had firſt that right principle of Holineſs wrought in their hearts. Without the principle of Holineſs it is impoſſible to have <hi>holy aimings, holy ends.</hi> It's impoſſible without an eye to ſee to level at a mark.</p>
               <p>Whereſoever there's a right doing, <hi>there's a potent elevating</hi> principle, that ſets the ſpirit above the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy of ſelf-ſeeking, and acts it <hi>into a reality of God-exalting</hi> above all, that kindles and inflames the ſoul into an ardency of deſire, love, delight of glorifying God in every undertaking.</p>
               <p>This is <hi>unſpeakably ſweet,</hi> and heart-gladding; nothing pleaſes a holy heart more then when the <hi>heart below</hi> can run in ſome degree parallel with the hearts of Saints and Angels above, in hallowing and advancing the higheſt God, and his Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Try we therefore</hi> if our meditating be a <hi>real acting up</hi> to the <hi>grand ſcope</hi> and higheſt end, the exalting of God, if his honour be indeed the preponderating inducement and greateſt ſoul-aim.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Happineſs <hi>and our own Salvation</hi> was the next aim formerly mentioned, happineſs propounded and declared in the Goſpel, and no other. To this next ſubordinate end muſt all the golden lines of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties tend, here they muſt center. Every right duty muſt be <hi>a real levelling at</hi> Goſpel-happineſs, that which <hi>God proffers,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt hath purchaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Meditation be right, it is a part of true wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for our ſelves, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.12. Wiſdom to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as really aimed at it, as any markſman aime at his mark,</p>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:47560:157"/>
               <p>God, next to himſelf and his glory, allows and requires to look and ſeek, labour and ſtrive for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life and happineſs; and all our duties, as they are ſubſervient to his glory, ſo our own happineſs <hi>is complicate and wrapt up in it,</hi> yet not above it, or equal with it, but next under it. Accordingly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in this duty, as in all others, <hi>our aim at happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt not be a meer ſelf-ſeeking, it muſt not termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate only in our ſelves; but our own happineſs muſt be aimed at for glorifying God by it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We <hi>muſt aim at happineſs,</hi> and being in Heaven, thereby <hi>to be in a moſt perfect ſtate,</hi> that we may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>the moſt perfect principle</hi> for the higheſt exalting of God.</p>
               <p>Althugh in Heaven, <hi>ſeeing more,</hi> and taſting more, and having the veſſels of body and ſoul filled up with glory and happineſs, makes our ſtate more glorious; yet the end of that ſeeing, taſting, and all enjoyings there, are to <hi>put us</hi> into a moſt perfect capacity, <hi>higheſt heart-readineſs,</hi> and <hi>alacrity,</hi> upon the moſt <hi>over-powring incentives</hi> to lift up to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the glorious praiſes of God. This then <hi>is a very conſiderable</hi> particular, that beſides glorifying God, the ſupreme end, aiming at our own ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt be more then for our ſelves.</p>
               <p>We uſe to ſpeak of ſeveral ſpiritual ends relating to our own ſpiritual good, which we are allowed to ſet up, and ſeek, and ſtrive after; yet all theſe muſt have <hi>this reduction,</hi> muſt all have this glory of God for their chief end.</p>
               <p>The laſt end, as hath been ſaid, gives the rules to all both ſubſervient ways and ends.</p>
               <p>Therefore in our examination, let us <hi>take in</hi> all the ſpiritual ends before ſpoken of, for <hi>heavenly light</hi>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:47560:158"/>and larger knowledge, for <hi>a ſpirit of wiſdom</hi> to be wiſer to ſalvation, to <hi>be warmer at</hi> the heart, melt off all incumbrances, make up to Heaven better, to fix our reſolutions firmer, ſtrengthen <hi>our grand pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> of ſtill walking with God, to <hi>ſtabliſh our courſe,</hi> and make <hi>ſtraiter ſteps for our feet, and to preſs har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the mark.</hi> Are our ſpirits <hi>acted to theſe aims,</hi> and all thoſe other, Meditation is ſo excellently and uſefully appointed to?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do we meditate <hi>in the right way</hi> of calling off our thoughts from <hi>impertinencies</hi> and diverſions?</p>
               <p>Do we <hi>ſet a ſtrong guard</hi> upon our ſpirits, and watch them diligently?</p>
               <p>Do we <hi>act Meditation</hi> in bending our minds to it, ſtrive to act with <hi>all ſeriouſneſs</hi> we can? Do we <hi>act ſearching</hi> and pondering, and <hi>keep up conſtancy</hi> of thoughts till we both bring our hearts to the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temper, and <hi>the duty to the kindly iſſue</hi> it ſhould have, and cannot be content with any thing, but that a God who ſees our actings will approve of?</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the Directions relating to Meditation. Firſt, for ſuch as would begin.</head>
               <p>AFter <hi>ſome Characters</hi> given of a right Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhall next <hi>ſpeak of Directions</hi> or Rules to be obſerved about it. The <hi>Rules muſt be ſuited</hi> to the ſeveral ſorts of perſons that will ſet upon this work, or proceed in it with ſucceſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If it be a perſon who would enter upon this
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:47560:158"/>way, being <hi>ſenſible of the ſin of</hi> hitherto neglecting it, and is now <hi>willing to be</hi> adviſed how to perform it.</p>
               <p>Then conſider, it is no undertaking it, or hope of doing it aright, and holding on with conſtancy, and to the ſpiritual advantages of it, unleſs there be an endeavour after a right principle, a living ſpring within to found and ſtill feed a due performance of this ſpiritual work.</p>
               <p>To undertake it without, thou wilt find it too high and hard, <hi>arrive at the beſt,</hi> at a <hi>formal doing,</hi> a ſlight and overly doing, and in <hi>the end grow weary</hi> of it, and caſt it off, and ſo return to it no more.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>thy great intendment,</hi> to which thou muſt bend thy ſelf and whole ſoul (which ſhould not, muſt not be given over, until it be effected) is to make ſure of a <hi>new heart,</hi> this will <hi>bring in a new power,</hi> a new <hi>principle, introduce a bent</hi> and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit, a <hi>love unto it,</hi> a firm and abiding pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, a <hi>rooted reſolution</hi> for doing it againſt all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and oppoſition. This will make the duty of Meditation eaſie, and alſo ſweet; by the pleaſure and advantages found in this heavenly way, thou wilt be encouraged to hold on, <hi>ſucceſs will encourage thee,</hi> that will ſweeten the way to thee, and help to ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh thee in it.</p>
               <p>Though thou canſt not <hi>change</hi> thy own heart, and make it new, <hi>lay in</hi> a new principle of Holineſs; but it muſt be God <hi>who gives the new heart,</hi> Ezek. 36.26, 27. <hi>And works the will and the deed of his own good pleaſure, Phil.</hi> 2.13. Yet as he calls thee to convert, and in order to thy converting, requires thee <hi>to conſider,</hi> and <hi>bethink thyſelf;</hi> ſo is it thy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and <hi>important duty</hi> to conſider and ponder deeply and frequently thoſe things, and in that
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:47560:159"/>manner &amp; order which are moſt effectual to that end, &amp; which God uſes to ſet home. For by putting thy ſelf into Gods preſcribed way of ſeriouſly and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidering, thou mayeſt meet with a help, with God helping at laſt, <hi>who helps them that ſeek him</hi> diligently, and give not over ſtriving.</p>
               <p>That <hi>relation is remarkable</hi> of the bad Son whom his father dying, calls to him, and gets him to make this promiſe, That every day he ſhould for but one quarter of an hour meditate of ſome one thing or other, what he would. Accordingly he every day employs a quarter of an hour, or ſome time in ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thinking: But this at laſt <hi>moſt happily</hi> iſſues in ſerious <hi>conſidering</hi> his ſinful ſtate, and <hi>a real convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to God at laſt.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>often it hath come to paſs,</hi> when perſons have ſet themſelves to conſider, as God in Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts, it hath <hi>ended</hi> in a true returning; ſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal is deſcribed, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>If thou art <hi>very deſirous</hi> more particularly to be here directed what to do to obtain the right princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and thence the right way of acting this duty and others in the holy and ſpiritual required man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>I muſt not engage far in ſo large a point, yet if I <hi>exceed ſomething,</hi> it will, I hope, get pardon. Only I ſhall mention ſome particulars more neceſſary for this ſo weighty a concern.</p>

               <p>For farther help, <hi>take the Book of Conſcience,</hi> thy <hi>Souls Regiſter,</hi> and God Remembrancer. Look o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the <hi>black Items</hi> there on the File, that it will certainly one day produce, and ſet before thy face.</p>
               <p>For <hi>yet ſurer aſſiſtance,</hi> take the perfect Rule and <hi>Glaſs of the Law</hi> and Word of Chriſt, therewith duely comparing thy life and frame of heart, that by the <hi>Laws coming, ſin may the more abound.</hi>

               <p>O but the Law, not only diſcovers guilt, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces a <hi>moſt dreadful curſe.</hi> Gal. 3.10. <hi>Curſed be every one that continues not in all things written in the Law, to do them.</hi> And as the Law, ſo the Goſpel curſes with a <hi>more dreadful curſe</hi> for not obeying it, in true coming to Chriſt by Faith. O what a curſe muſt this then be, <hi>to be accurſed</hi> firſt for original corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in all the <hi>helliſh wickedneſs</hi> of it: And then to <hi>he curſed</hi> for all thy innumerable actual trangreſſions. <hi>Accurſed for the firſt act of</hi> ſinning. <hi>Accurſed</hi> for the next act. And for every new ſin to have a <hi>new ſentence,</hi> be under a new curſe. For every, <hi>every evil thought,</hi> every evil <hi>affection, purpoſe, word, work, every commiſſion, every omiſſion, every day, for all the ſins of it, to be accurſed, from the beginning to the end of it. Really</hi> by the curſe, to be <hi>ſeparated</hi> to evil, bound over to death eternal in Hell. How ſhould this ſtartle and awaken thee?</p>
               <p>O but there's yet that is more dreadful, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually for ſin, under the <hi>hot diſpleaſure</hi> and abiding wrath of a God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.11. <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day.</hi> Joh. 3.36. <hi>He that believeth not, the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> This God, ſo
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:47560:162"/>angry for ſin, how <hi>infinitely able is he</hi> to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and <hi>how reſolved is he,</hi> unleſs thou turn to him? O what is that death eternal, that Hell provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to puniſh ſinners!</p>
               <p>How <hi>frail is thy life,</hi> by which thou art kept from falling into the Lake of fire and brimſtone?</p>
               <p>How <hi>certain is thy death,</hi> and how uncertain is thy dying time? It may come in a moment, and then thou art caſt upon eternal ruine.</p>
               <p>Conſider, thy ſins, <hi>after commiſſion,</hi> grow not leſs, <hi>wear not out,</hi> are not leſs dangerous. <hi>Sin is the ſame for ſubſtance, though thy ſenſe of them be leſs;</hi> we greatly deceive our ſelves herein, as if ſin, the longer after commiſſion, were leſs; but the <hi>guilt</hi> of ſin is the ſame, the <hi>defilement</hi> the ſame, the <hi>curſe</hi> againſt them is in the ſame force, the <hi>wrath,</hi> diſpleaſure, and reſolution of God to revenge them, full out the very ſame, and <hi>Gods remembrance</hi> of them is ever the ſame. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.2. <hi>I remember all their wickedneſs;</hi> and how is that? <hi>They are before my face. If they are not before thy face,</hi> as God can ſet them, <hi>yet they are before his face, Pſal.</hi> 50.21.51.9. that is, ſeen and remembred as a thing ſet full in a mans eye, and his eye full on them.</p>
               <p>I have <hi>been too bold in</hi> thus enlarging. O 'tis hard to <hi>awake</hi> from the deep ſleep of ſin.

               <p>But this ſo infinitely free love of the Father, muſt be <hi>connected</hi> with moſt wiſhly viewing and moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt pondering the <hi>higheſt proof and evidence</hi> of it, in that <hi>greateſt poſſible gift,</hi> Gods own Son, God in our Nature. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that,</hi> &amp;c. Here <hi>after all thy</hi> black and ſad thoughts and diſquiets, is the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, ſtrongeſt, and <hi>ſureſt Cordial</hi> for a fainting heart. <hi>A Chriſt in whom all fulneſs of wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification, and redemption dwell;</hi> That out of his own infinite love, became man, was in the <hi>form of a ſervant, performed</hi> the whole Law, <hi>pacified</hi> the wrath of God, <hi>purchaſed</hi> perfect and eternal life, by <hi>laying down</hi> his life a ranſom. 1. A <hi>Chriſt freely offered by
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:47560:165"/>God</hi> the Father, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. <hi>Come and buy without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</hi> 2. <hi>Freely offering himſelf,</hi> Joh. 7.37. <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come to me and drink.</hi> 3. <hi>Freely offered,</hi> and to be taken as the Bride and the Spirit ſay, <hi>Come and drink of the water of life freely,</hi> Rev. 22.17. This free grace muſt be <hi>applied by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> of grace and pardon <hi>more eſpecially</hi> and firſt. <hi>Chriſt is not offered by God the Father, and the Lord Chriſt offers not himſelf, nor the Holy Spirit offers not, neither draws to Chriſt, but on the ground of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of forgiveneſs and ſalvation. Nor can it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by man, as a learned Divine expreſſes it, but</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diante promiſſione.</p>
               <p>The promiſes <hi>particularly muſt be pondered</hi> duely, often and often.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ponder</hi> 1. <hi>The goodneſs</hi> of them, they are good, ſweet indeed to a needy thirſty ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ponder</hi> 2. <hi>The ſureneſs</hi> and firmneſs, by a God that cannot lye, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. <hi>All yea and Amen in Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>The promiſes muſt be pondered, <hi>prayed often over,</hi> as thoſe which are for the <hi>wounded, weary,</hi> and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy laden, to <hi>breed faith;</hi> not only to <hi>feed</hi> it, but <hi>found,</hi> and <hi>feed</hi> it alſo; to <hi>begin,</hi> and to build it up.

               <p>OUr next <hi>Work,</hi> after Directions to thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſucceſsfully practiſe holy Meditation, having formerly neglected it, is to <hi>treat</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for <hi>young Chriſtians,</hi> who are but <hi>entered</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their way, how beſt to order their right princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple received, to their beſt advantage in this way of Meditation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here, as the Rule of <hi>learned Phyſicians</hi> is, in curing of diſeaſes, that <hi>univerſals</hi> are firſt to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: So firſt your Rule is (to <hi>enter</hi> and <hi>engage</hi> your ſelves into that great Road, and moſt ordinary work incumbent, of daily Meditation) herein to contend and ſtrive after an <hi>habitual holy frame,</hi> to <hi>habit</hi> thy ſelf as thou art able, to the <hi>right daily</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Habit and accuſtom</hi> thy ſelf to the mornings Meditation, in awaking ſo <hi>ſtill</hi> with God, in ſerious <hi>thinkings</hi> of, and <hi>admirings</hi> his goodneſs and mercy in the night paſt.</p>
               <p>Begin to <hi>accuſtom</hi> thy ſelf to <hi>firſt looking up</hi> to God, and that moſt ſeriouſly and earneſtly, that ſo near as may be, God <hi>ever</hi> may be the <hi>firſt</hi> in thy thoughts. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. <hi>When I awake, I am ever with thee.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>Give ear unto my meditation— In the morning, O Lord, will I direct or ſet in order,</hi> as the word properly ſignifies, <hi>and look up.</hi> He awaked into Meditation, and acted that Meditation, in lifting up his heart in praying. To
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:47560:166"/>
                  <hi>improve holy thoughts and holy deſires,</hi> Gods being ever the <hi>firſt</hi> in our thoughts on awaking, is <hi>certainly</hi> more his due and proper right, than any other things in the world.</p>
               <p>It is alſo the very <hi>beſt thought-beſtowing,</hi> the beſt laying out our precious thoughts for our own profit; beſt as to the <hi>help</hi> and furtherance of grace; beſt for <hi>freſh incomes</hi> of ſweet peace.</p>
               <p>When firſt we act Heaven-ward, we act <hi>freeſt</hi> and <hi>freſheſt,</hi> when the ſpirit acts upward, before <hi>luſts</hi> and corruptions are <hi>ſtirring,</hi> before <hi>Satan</hi> begins to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe, and before the <hi>world</hi> comes in to us, to hang on its weights upon our hearts.</p>
               <p>It is far more <hi>acceptable</hi> to the Majeſty of the high God, to have the <hi>firſt viſit</hi> and homage; likewiſe more <hi>beneficial</hi> to our ſelves, to <hi>get the ſtart</hi> of other things, to give our hearts firſt a heavenly ſeaſoning.</p>
               <p>The <hi>veſſel</hi> will be the <hi>ſweeter,</hi> and retain an after better ſavourineſs for the coming day, when this is well and ſeriouſly done. <hi>Viſit God early, and he will viſit us early.</hi> This awaking <hi>will occaſion the Holy Spirits awaking and blowing on the garden of thy heart for the ſpices to flow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Come then to that Meditation relating to the duties of the <hi>ſucceeding day,</hi> this then muſt be well attended for making a good entrance into this new courſe of Meditation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here <hi>to ſtrive after the true wiſdom</hi> of this way, to be an Artiſt in ſome meaſure, a <hi>wife Meditater.</hi> At the firſt we cannot be too wiſe, nor underſtand too well a way new begun. Nor never can we here be ſo wiſe for doing any part of our ſpiritual work, but we may learn more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To have a due <hi>temper of warmth,</hi> fervour, and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:47560:167"/>vivacity, this muſt be minded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Fervent in ſpirit.</hi> To begin a <hi>courſe dully,</hi> act eaſily, and not earneſtly, this wrongs thee much, it hinders the <hi>otherwiſe obtainable faeility of doing,</hi> with that <hi>rare ſweetneſs</hi> attending a holy ſeriouſneſs, and the <hi>rich improvement</hi> of the main ſtock, that ſtock of grace given for increaſing. A habit comes not up by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs</hi> actings, but by <hi>earneſt</hi> actings. Cold water cannot be made <hi>boiling</hi> hot, and kept ſo, by adding <hi>luke-warm water,</hi> but water very hot. <hi>Eaſie actings</hi> will <hi>diſintend</hi> and abate the habit, where attained; and hinder the attaining, where aimed at. <hi>Eaſie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours</hi> will ſetle in a <hi>ſpiritual lazineſs, ſet up at a formality;</hi> but equal and earneſt, will <hi>itroduce</hi> a ſtrong habit and high.</p>
               <p>Get the <hi>habitual fervency</hi> by daily actings of heat, and being fervent in every doing. So when the Apoſtle urges fervency of ſpirit, he means a ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in all <hi>ſerving</hi> the Lord at all times.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As you muſt do this in reference to <hi>daily</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation in the general way of it, ſo <hi>habit</hi> and <hi>accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi> thy ſelf to meditating of thy <hi>chief</hi> and <hi>ſupreme</hi> end.</p>
               <p>To a due and earneſt meditating of God, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying him; for this gives the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> to all thy courſe. If the queſtion were, <hi>What is the beſt</hi> thought ariſing any time in any heart, it is that <hi>which</hi> is of God, the glorifying of him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>pureſt</hi> higheſt thoughts of a God exalting him, <hi>muſt needs excel all other thoughts,</hi> more than the <hi>Sun</hi> excels all candles or leaſt lights whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Uſe thy thoughts with <hi>David</hi> and other holy men of God, to <hi>bear ſtrongly,</hi> and act ardently upon this. This lays <hi>the foundation daily deeper of thy ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:47560:167"/>Mark</hi> 8.34. that ſo hard and tough work.</p>
               <p>Self would not <hi>riſe up and float ſo high</hi> in any good heart, if glorifying the <hi>infinitely better God were more meditated daily upon,</hi> and had its more <hi>due</hi> and <hi>down weight</hi> in the ſcales of the Chriſtians thoughts, had more ſerious muſing upon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Habit <hi>thy ſelf,</hi> gain upon thy ſelf as to ſerious daily Meditation on the <hi>next end</hi> and ſcope, thy own eternal happineſs and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Let not this ſo <hi>momentous</hi> concern want its weight in thy daily meditating; let it have ſtill <hi>ſome at leaſt</hi> ſerious pondering: and this <hi>not only at thy firſt entrance</hi> upon this way of daily meditating, then when thy fears and <hi>feelings of wrath</hi> remain <hi>freſh</hi> in memory. But here is the Art and frame to be endeavoured, to <hi>grow up in more habitual ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> of muſing on this great ſalvation.</p>
               <p>This was the bleſſed Apoſtles way; he <hi>not only at firſt</hi> when Chriſt humbled him, began it, to meditate how to be ſaved, but <hi>eyed it daily,</hi> accuſtomed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into ſerious, more ſerious minding it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13. <hi>I forget things behind, and preſs to the mark.</hi> He kept his <hi>conſtant</hi> aiming, and aimed better, ſtill more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and therefore <hi>the act being ſtronger, the habit muſt be more intended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The habit of meditating here, ſhould not <hi>ſink</hi> and be in a conſumption, decline, and grow weaker, or but keep up alive; but it ſhould <hi>root deeper,</hi> put forth ſtronger, ſhoot up higher to the mark. Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould have <hi>quicker</hi> and more <hi>lively impreſſions</hi> on us, like the <hi>natural</hi> motion, though ſlack at firſt, yet quick at laſt.</p>
               <p>That's more natural and genuine which grows ſtill ſtronger, like <hi>rich wine more ſtrong</hi> and ſpirit by keeping cloſe.</p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:47560:168"/>
               <p n="5">5. Contend <hi>to habiting thy ſelf</hi> to ponder thoſe particular means making up to the grand ends of glorifying God, and thy happineſs in enjoyment of him for ever. Namely,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Accuſtom thy ſelf to as <hi>high and tranſporting thoughts of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> his fulneſs of grace freely offered, and thy <hi>daily putting him</hi> on more, and growing up in him. And this by <hi>Meditation of the precious Promiſes and the Faith,</hi> whereby thou muſt through them, receive from Chriſt, and live by it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. So accuſtom thy ſelf daily to Meditation of the <hi>Holy Spirits</hi> dwelling and operating in every good heart, without whoſe aſſiſtance thou canſt not perform any good; therefore muſt not be <hi>neglected, grieved, quenched, reſiſted,</hi> but <hi>prayed for and cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, earneſtly expected, and highly entertained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Accuſtom thy ſelf to ſome <hi>ſeriouſneſs</hi> of thoughts of the <hi>Ordinances of Chriſt,</hi> the ways of our Communion with God (we have no other means for it) and the walks wherein the Spirit comes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Uſe to caſt a <hi>wiſhly eye</hi> on all ſuch conducing things, formerly mentioned, as thou canſt have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Look to <hi>well enter into, and fix upon the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, daily examination, of review, looking over mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the day,</hi> and if <hi>hindered at any time, help it by after-induſtry.</hi> I ſay the Meditation of <hi>Review</hi> in the cloſe of the day, to ſee, and judge thy ſelf as to thy hearts frame, and thy carriage in the time of the day.</p>
               <p>This at the firſt is like the working with an <hi>Awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand;</hi> this muſt not be <hi>ſlubbered</hi> over, ſlightly done. But being harſh and unpleaſant work at firſt, thou muſt ſo manage it in care and conſtancy, that thou
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:47560:168"/>mayſt <hi>gain a hand at it,</hi> it may become eaſie and pleaſant. <hi>Suarez</hi> a Jeſuit ſays of himſelf, that his times of <hi>ſelf-reflection,</hi> and examining his conſcience for matters of the day, were the <hi>ſweeteſt part</hi> of all the day.</p>
               <p>Thy Rule muſt be to perform this work, ſo as it proves <hi>eaſier and ſweeter,</hi> and thereby thou impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt in it.</p>
               <p>The more <hi>impartial and ſincere</hi> you are in it, the ſweeter you will find it. The <hi>more accurate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite your inquiries and heart-ſearchings are, and the more impartial towards your ſelf, the ſweeter peace, the higher boldneſs and confidence will thy heart be filled with. For this brings in the clearer evidence of thy ſincerity, thy impartiality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing <hi>perfumes</hi> the ſpirit of a Chriſtian with ſweeter peace and more heavenly joy, than a <hi>clear diſcovery of the hearts uprightneſs and integrity,</hi> which by ſearching our hearts, and <hi>impartially judging</hi> them, we attain. As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.1, 2. David prays, <hi>Judge me, O Lord, for I have walkt in mine integrity.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.23. <hi>Search me, and ſee if any way of wickedneſs be in me.</hi> This came from his own firſt impartial ſearching, and finding his ſincerity. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſual and diligent ſelf-ſearching</hi> brings in, and keeps up a ſetled peace and confidence, by a <hi>mans</hi> being daily more aſſured of <hi>ſincerity</hi> and heart-uprightneſs.</p>
               <p>Be careful therefore and diligent in this ſelf-ſearching.</p>

                  <item>1. The <hi>Caſe of thy aſſurance,</hi> either wanting, and not yet attained, or elſe weak and feeble.</item>
                  <item>2. It muſt be <hi>ſomething relating</hi> to ſanctification, thy weak grace, and many imperfections here, the purging of thy heart from divers evils, <hi>ſubduing</hi> of new riſing and ſtirring corruptions; ſome <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſin</hi> that haunts and troubles thee; ſome <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which follows thee; ſome <hi>croſs</hi> or <hi>affliction</hi> lying heavy upon thee: or any other <hi>particulars</hi> wherein thou art concerned, here to meditate how to have help the beſt and ſpeedieſt.</item>

               <p n="1">1. That is a principal point of wiſdom, to ſtudy and ponder the <hi>caſe of thy peace</hi> and <hi>aſſurance</hi> of Gods love and favour, if not yet obtained; or but enjoyed in a ſmall meaſure, accompanied with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers doubts and fears; to <hi>meditate</hi> how beſt thou mayſt come to aſſurance, and be ſtrong and ſtabliſht in it.</p>
               <p>How to have thy <hi>good condition</hi> made out to thee, and thy fears, diſcouragements, and doubts may ſeatter and be driven away.</p>

Aſſurance is chiefly bottomed on our ſanctification aſſured. So Divines ſay, aſſurance of Election, Juſtification, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, and Gloriſication, cannot be without aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Sanctification, this being the ground of our aſſurance in the other four.</p>
               <p>In <hi>particular</hi> thou muſt labour to draw forth out of the ſure Word of Chriſt, the <hi>infallible Characters</hi> &amp; clear deſcriptions and evidences of the new creature, and of <hi>ſincerity</hi> of grace; then meditate and ponder ſo duely upon theſe <hi>ſure</hi> evidences and right Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-deſcriptions given of the new Creature and ſincerity of grace, as to <hi>come</hi> to as clear and diſtinct an underſtanding of what is held forth to thee as thou canſt. I paſs divers things might be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſhall touch on the following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As that <hi>change</hi> and <hi>renewing</hi> of the mind and judgment, which in reſpect of <hi>ſin,</hi> is to have it out of meaſure ſinful, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13. The <hi>greateſt evil</hi> in
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:47560:170"/>all the world, as that only contrariety and emnity to the greateſt good, namely the <hi>infinitely bleſſed God,</hi> his inſinite holineſs and purity, and all his ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely glorious Attributes; yea <hi>his very Being,</hi> with his Soveraignty and Government; <hi>all his</hi> moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, righteous, and good Laws, and Word, the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and demonſtration of his Soveraignty over us, and of his will concerning us. Hereby likewiſe manifeſting the <hi>extreme injuriouſneſs</hi> and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in ſin, in regard of God, whom upon infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and indiſpenſible obligations we are engaged perfectly to obey.</p>
               <p>And as the <hi>abounding</hi> ſinfulneſs of ſin muſt be ſeen, ſo as the judgment <hi>diſallows all known ſin,</hi> the very leaſt; ſo there muſt be <hi>an univerſal liking, and an allowance of all good,</hi> of all known Truths, and all known Duties; <hi>Truths</hi> as revealed by God, and to be believed by us; and <hi>Duties</hi> commanded by God, and to be performed by us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In ſeeing the fulneſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. of beauty and excellency, with the mightineſs of Chriſt to ſave in all reſpects, all that come to God by him by faith, with <hi>the vanity of all earthly</hi> things to make us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and <hi>the excellency of Grace,</hi> Holineſs, Faith, Love, and the other required heavenly graces and ſoul-abilities and beauties above all other endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This is the firſt part, the firſt right change of the mind and judgment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>Whereas the natural man knows not the things of God, nor can he, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The next part of the new Creature, is that change and new heavenly frame of that <hi>noble facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the will,</hi> Rom. 7.18. <hi>To will is preſent.</hi> Oft in the Pſalms <hi>David</hi> mentions his <hi>will,</hi> his choice, his
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:47560:170"/>curpoſe, his firm and <hi>rooted</hi> reſolution, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.8. <hi>I will keep thy ſtatutes.</hi> Verſ. 30. <hi>I have choſen the way of truth.</hi> Verſ. 106. <hi>I have ſworn, and will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to keep thy righteous judgments.</hi> Iſa. 56.4. <hi>That abuſe the</hi> things which pleaſe, Gods own deſcription of a gracious frame of ſpirit, by a gracious choice. Contrary, <hi>a ſinful unconverted</hi> heart is deſcribed by <hi>thuſing things</hi> that are ſinful and provoking. I ſay the <hi>change of the will</hi> is a high evidence of ſincerity, <hi>a chuſing of God</hi> for our God, <hi>chuſing of Chriſt,</hi> his offered grace, above all him to our Righteouſneſs and Juſtification, our Wiſdom, our Sanctification; ſo <hi>coming to,</hi> taking of, truſting on him, is <hi>an act of the will,</hi> in chuſing him, a chuſing the holy ways of God univerſally, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Reſpect to all thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> This not ſo much in <hi>knowing,</hi> as <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of heart</hi> for keeping all.</p>
               <p>To add but one thing more. The new Creature is principally ſeen in <hi>a new will,</hi> and <hi>a new will in a new aim,</hi> altering <hi>utterly</hi> that old, ſinful, carnal aim, of <hi>carnal ſelf,</hi> and ſatisfying of it, ſinfully aiming at only or chiefly ſelf, and ſatisfying ſelf in worldly and carnal things. This Idol <hi>Self, the grand aim is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down,</hi> is no more the ſouls <hi>Maſter-mark,</hi> that gave all the Laws, made every thing ſerve to it, and end in it; eyeing of <hi>ſelf</hi> chiefly, aiming at, ſeeking and ſtriving moſt for ſelf, is <hi>changed;</hi> and there's a <hi>new Maſter-aim, a new mark</hi> to which it deſigns, and principally drives at, God and his glory, ſerving and pleaſing him. This evidently appears in the Saints in Scripture. They <hi>exalt God,</hi> called ſuch as ſeek God, ſerve God, <hi>live to God,</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.26. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.6. This the generation of them that ſeek him, and deny themſelves: <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Alive
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:47560:171"/>unto God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.15. <hi>Live not to themſelves, but to him that dyed for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Univerſal <hi>allowance</hi> of all known good in the mind.</item>
                  <item>2. Univerſal <hi>abhorrence</hi> of all known evil; chuſing all good, and an univerſal purpoſe of will, to pleaſe God in all things, are the things the ſincerity of them ſtands of thoſe two noble faculties renewed.</item>
                  <item>3. A real change of the <hi>corrupt, carnal,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly movings of the <hi>affections,</hi> to a making them holy and heavenly, to ſetting them on the things <hi>above,</hi> and <hi>taking them off</hi> really the things below, from their uſual ſway, rule, violent running to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and earthly things, and from their cuſtomary and predominant deadneſs, flatneſs, and remiſſneſs to and in ſpiritual and heavenly things.</item>
               </list>
               <p>A change <hi>really upon the great</hi> and leading affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, love the great <hi>weight</hi> that carries all; <hi>Amor meus eſt pondus meum,</hi> as the devout Ancient ſaid. My ſouls love is my ſouls weight, the ſtrong biaſs that ſtill leads it. <hi>Hence ariſe the other holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are acted from love,</hi> deſire, delight, ſorrow, fear, hatred of all known evil, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.10. <hi>Ye that love the Lord, hate evil,</hi> Pſal. 119.104. <hi>I hate every falſe way.</hi> A Character it is of a wicked man, <hi>he abhors not evil, Pſal.</hi> 36.4. But a <hi>holy heart</hi> when it comes <hi>even new out of the furnace,</hi> is new caſt, new made, it's <hi>ſtampt with predominant love to God</hi> and his ways, and with <hi>new ſelf-loathing</hi> and ſin-abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>A new heart will I give you.</hi> Verſ. 36. <hi>Then ſhall ye remember your evil ways, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight for your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities and for your abominations.</hi> I ſhall add no more particulars. The truth and ſincerity of this
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:47560:171"/>whole work wrought firſt in thee <hi>really,</hi> and then known, muſt be the ground for evidencing of thy <hi>aſſurance,</hi> which muſt be done by comparing the <hi>pattern</hi> of the new Creature, deſcribed in the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Word of Chriſt, <hi>and the copy of it drawn in thy heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such <hi>ſerious ſearching</hi> and due meditating with praying and other ordinances, muſt be on thy part; thou muſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Give all diligence to make thy calling and election ſure.</hi> But withal there muſt be a due <hi>conſideration,</hi> and <hi>praying</hi> for the evidenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſealing Spirit of Chriſt the Comforter, and diligent ſtill attending upon thoſe ways and means of grace the Holy Spirit uſes to come and ſeal and comfort in.</p>
               <p>I know <hi>other things might be mentioned,</hi> eſpecially in a <hi>purpoſely handling</hi> this Doctrine of Aſſurance. The manner of Gods working in ſuch as are <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> drawn to Chriſt, differs in <hi>circumſtances,</hi> and in the ſenſible <hi>perceivings</hi> of it, accordingly as God pleaſes to work: and aſſurance, as the Spirit pleaſes, is given in a different way.</p>
               <p>But trying by this <hi>change</hi> upon the heart in a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the mind,</hi> ſubduing, and turning that great wheel of the ſoul, the refractory and <hi>ſtubborn will,</hi> changing the main aim from ſelf and the creature to God in Chriſt. Really <hi>plucking up the affections root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the earth,</hi> and finding them ſet upon things above; an evident change and turning the <hi>grand affection of love out of its old channel,</hi> and a placing it upon God, his Word, ways, and people, the Saints above all other things: when theſe things <hi>freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee</hi> of God, and <hi>by the Spirit of God received, are made known to be in thee,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. this is a
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:47560:172"/>right aſſurance. <hi>O pray, pray for this ſealing</hi> and aſſuring Spirit, this will <hi>help</hi> thee againſt the fears, doubts, deceits of thy own heart, and Satans me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, and clear up thy good condition to thee.</p>
               <p>This aſſurance attained, the next <hi>Meditation</hi> muſt be of the <hi>beſt ways</hi> of keeping and preſerving it, which muſt be <hi>endeavoured;</hi> yea, of thy growing up to the <hi>riches and fulneſs</hi> of aſſurance, to a Pleropho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as it is called. The preſerving of aſſurance, and growing up in it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. muſt be by care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence uſed about it, and uſed for exacter walking in all Chriſts ways. Endeavours of <hi>mortifying</hi> thy corruptions, <hi>combating</hi> with Satan and the world, and getting victory, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. <hi>To him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh, I will give him a white ſtone with a new name.</hi> The <hi>white ſtone</hi> is thy Juſtification, the <hi>new name</hi> is Adoption of Sons, both aſſured upon victory ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>There muſt be a <hi>tender care</hi> of obedience to and <hi>compliance</hi> with the Holy Spirit, and of not grieving of it. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God whereby ye are ſealed to the day of redemption.</hi> If thou wouldſt have the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> a <hi>ſealing Spirit,</hi> thou muſt not be a <hi>Griever</hi> of that Spirit, by any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>neglectings</hi> and ilightings of it, or by <hi>contrary</hi> walkings to it; wilful and <hi>preſumptuous evils</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially provoke and grieve, and will hinder aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. <hi>God will ſpeak peace to his Saints, but let them not turn again to folly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This in <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51.8. <hi>Make me to hear joy and gladneſs, that the bones thou haſt broken may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</hi> Some Saints by their <hi>falls</hi> have <hi>felt</hi> it long, it may be <hi>ever after,</hi> as great bruiſes in the body.

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of the next Meditation, namely, how weak and imperfect thy Grace is.</head>
               <p>THis is a <hi>Meditation</hi> very neceſſary for making thee very <hi>humble,</hi> greatly fearful and careful, and highly to <hi>provoke</hi> thee to contend to a growth and ſtrength of grace, to be <hi>rooted</hi> and ſtabliſht daily more.</p>
               <p>When a ſoul comes to look and ſearch into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſees what little <hi>grace</hi> he hath, what abundance of corruptions, and in what power they ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. When he finds how he is <hi>aſſaulted</hi> by Satan, and <hi>enſnared</hi> by the world, and things of it, he ſees how <hi>neceſſary</hi> it is to conſider what in this caſe he is to do. This therefore after aſſurance in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree obtained, and how to keep and increaſe it, may well be the matter of Meditation.</p>
               <p>Meditate then of thy <hi>grace received,</hi> the weakneſs and imperfection of it, and how to help and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then it, eſpecially thy <hi>Faith,</hi> that great <hi>fundamental Grace,</hi> that ſerves as the <hi>eye</hi> to ſee Chriſt, the <hi>foot</hi> to come to him, and <hi>hand</hi> to take him, <hi>lean upon,</hi> and to take and receive from him.</p>
               <p>In the caſe of <hi>weakneſs of grace,</hi> thy Meditation muſt be upon that purpoſely <hi>conferred fulneſs, Cor.</hi> 1.19. that fountain-fulneſs, which is in Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

But <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me.</hi> Conſider thou muſt, that he will <hi>help</hi> thee: If Chriſt did firſt help thee, <hi>when thou wert a ſtranger</hi> and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to him, <hi>now much more</hi> will he help thee, being reconciled: If when thou hadſt no union, wert no member of his, he made thee a member; much more being a member will he ſupply life, ſtrength, and growth to make thee a <hi>perfect member:</hi> he muſt make his body in all the members perfect at laſt. They muſt <hi>grow</hi> therefore, that he may be a head perfected, in all his members perfection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The way Chriſt will teach thee, ſeeking to him. The work Chriſt will work for thee, truſting in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Then as thy Meditation muſt be of Chriſt the Well of living waters, and his fulneſs, ſo (becauſe the Well, though a <hi>living Spring,</hi> yet it is deep) how to come at it, how to draw. The next Meditation therefore muſt be of our <hi>means vouchſafed</hi> us to draw, and of particularly that, by which all the Saints, in all Ages, have drawn out of this Well of Salvation, and received grace for grace.</p>
               <p>Therefore this Meditation muſt be of that <hi>precious powerful Faith,</hi> whereby Chriſt is received; <hi>initial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> by our firſt union and communion with him; and received alſo <hi>gradually</hi> daily, and for our build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to perfection in him, Meditation muſt be, as of Faith, to fetch ſupply from Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:47560:173"/>
               <p n="3">3. So of the way <hi>Faith</hi> hath to act, namely, by the precious <hi>Promiſes of Sanctification,</hi> in which Chriſt aſſures thee, he will not <hi>break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flax,</hi> Matth. 12.20.</p>
               <p>That the Kingdom of Heaven at firſt is as a <hi>grain of muſtard-ſeed, but it becomes as a great tree,</hi> Matth. 13.31, 32. <hi>That the good work in any heart God will finiſh to the day of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.6.</p>
               <p>Thou muſt repair to the rich Treaſury of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, gather up <hi>the Pearls of Promiſes</hi> ſcattered all over it, <hi>ſtring them up</hi> in Meditation, and ponder their <hi>infallible Truth,</hi> abundant <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and moſt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent <hi>Freeneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Next thou muſt meditate duely of the way for the <hi>full Breaſts of the Promiſes,</hi> to give down into thy <hi>longing ſpirit,</hi> their ſweetneſs and help. This is by Chriſts <hi>appointed Ordinances,</hi> praying, and the reſt, wherein thy Faith muſt act upon the Promiſes, and by them upon Jeſus Chriſt; and ſo, though that <hi>Well be deep,</hi> Faith is thy <hi>Bucket,</hi> the Promiſes the <hi>Chain,</hi> the Ordinances the <hi>Hands</hi> to let it down, and draw it up, filled with living water for thy thirſty ſoul to drink.</p>

               <p>THis Meditation muſt proceed upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of <hi>ſin-ſubduing and mortifying. Mich.</hi> 7.19. <hi>He will ſubdue our iniquities.</hi> Rom. 6.14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</hi> A man under the Law, <hi>it gives no ſtrength</hi> againſt ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. It <hi>diſcovers</hi> ſin, and <hi>irritates</hi> ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8, 9. but gives no ſtrength to ſubdue it. But being under Goſpel-grace, that <hi>gives power</hi> to mortifie ſin. <hi>Thoſe that are Chriſts, have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts,</hi> Gal. 5.24. <hi>They are dead to ſin, Rom.</hi> 6.2. by Chriſt, purchaſing the <hi>total mortification,</hi> and dead by an <hi>Initial</hi> and begun ſanctification, that from being implanted into Chriſts death, and his ſin-killing grace, ſin receives its <hi>deaths wound,</hi> and ſhall <hi>bleed to death</hi> upon it. But this by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frequently the promiſes of mortification, <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing</hi> Faith by them, <hi>exciting</hi> Faith to reſt on them. Let us therefore, as for other caſes, ſo for this, gather up <hi>variety of promiſes</hi> of ſin-ſubduing.</p>
               <p>Let thy eye in Meditation go <hi>from promiſe</hi> to promiſe. Firſt, <hi>ſet one promiſe</hi> before thee, and dwell upon that, <hi>look to Chriſt in that,</hi> and thence draw help from him, reſting on him, for making it good to thy ſouls caſe, and then <hi>go to, and dwell upon another,</hi> ponder that, and reſt again upon Chriſt in that promiſe, and ſo ſucceſſively upon others.</p>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:47560:174"/>
               <p>Thou haſt <hi>great varieties</hi> of Promiſes, that thy eye in Meditation might be more <hi>delighted</hi> in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>this Garden of Chriſt,</hi> among theſe pleaſant ſweet flowers; and that Faith might <hi>by the variety</hi> feed more to the full upon them.</p>
               <p>In the caſe of a <hi>particular corruption,</hi> ſometimes, yea, it may be often too hard for thee. Thy now Meditation muſt paſs in a <hi>more particular manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>great pondering</hi> of the <hi>ſinfulneſs</hi> of this ſin, as the Scripture in the divers paſſages of it, ſets it forth, in the kind and nature, in the degrees, aggravations, and abounding ſinfulneſs of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the <hi>terrible threatnings</hi> denounced againſt it, which diſcover Gods not dealing tenderly, and handling it as it were gently. What <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom</hi> in his rebellion, &amp; warring againſt him openly, <hi>Deal for my ſake gently with the young man Abſalom,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.5. that we are ready to do, with apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Threatnings</hi> to our corruptions, loth to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply him <hi>too hot,</hi> and <hi>too home,</hi> and let theſe <hi>Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives</hi> continue their time, becauſe of their ſmart and pain: But we ſhould both get <hi>ſtore of threatnings,</hi> give them all the <hi>edge</hi> we can, apply them <hi>cloſe,</hi> and let them <hi>ſtick faſt,</hi> and <hi>ſtay their juſt time,</hi> to iſſue in due fear and awakning, and make thee more willing to forego thy ſin.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Threatnings</hi> of the Law, and Word of Chriſt are of <hi>great neceſſity,</hi> and uſe for godly ſpirits, ſo God and the Saints in Scripture uſed them for humblings, awaknings, and reformings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This ſins ſinfulneſs in Examples.</hi> In the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of ſeverity,</hi> recorded both of wicked and godly perſons, Gods ſeverity to them, yea <hi>Examples</hi> of ſometimes <hi>high and amazing ſeverities</hi> againſt
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:47560:175"/>ſins lookt on as <hi>low and little</hi> in their nature, God cannot <hi>over-puniſh</hi> any the leaſt ſin here. The high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſeverity is lower, and far beneath the Hell due for the leaſt ſin. O let Meditation apply all the <hi>Engines,</hi> diſcharge all the <hi>great and ſmall ſhot,</hi> give it all the <hi>broad-ſides,</hi> and <hi>Thunders of Threatnings</hi> of wrath, death, and Hell, <hi>ſpit flames of fire</hi> in the face of this ſin; get <hi>all the ſtrongeſt Arguments,</hi> higheſt <hi>Incentives,</hi> with all poſſible means and ways to help in this caſe.</p>
               <p>When a Ship hath ſprung a Leak; when the Sea hath made a remarkable breach, men preſently run, ſtudy, and apply all poſſible ways of ſtopping it.</p>
               <p>When thy ſoul hath <hi>ſprung a leak,</hi> that will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſink thee, without due help, in time uſed.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Sea of ſin</hi> hath made a <hi>dangerous breach,</hi> ſpeedily uſe all effectual means to heal it. Faithful Phyſicians, when a Patient is endangered by that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe which is a caſe of <hi>great difficulty,</hi> how do they ſtudy and ſtrive, with utmoſt Art and induſtry, to cure it? When it is a <hi>great Soul-caſe,</hi> of moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous diſtemper; when a <hi>Tendency</hi> to great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; when a <hi>high Diſadvantage</hi> to peace, comfort, ſtrenght, growth, fruitfulneſs, there ſhould be both <hi>haſtening</hi> and <hi>heightning,</hi> utmoſt intending of thoughts, care, induſtry in all poſſible ways. Do it to ſave <hi>heart-ſmart</hi> and <hi>hazard.</hi> Do it <hi>to ſave God a labour</hi> of uſing ſharper means, <hi>ſad, ſoaking, long, and abiding</hi> trouble to make thee conſider, make thee willing to part with that member, that <hi>right foot,</hi> or <hi>hand</hi> or <hi>eye,</hi> whatever it be. Ah! but above all, take that <hi>higheſt inducement,</hi> and ſtrive to be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, moſt induſtrious and <hi>exquiſite Artiſt,</hi> in ſelecting ſweeteſt, ſtrongeſt, and moſt efficacious Goſpel-argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:47560:175"/>for <hi>aggravating</hi> thy ſin, and looſning thy heart, <hi>unſoddering</hi> it from that ſin that cleaves ſo faſt.</p>
               <p>And let the <hi>Maſter-piece of all</hi> be the deep and great ponderings of the ſo <hi>aſtoniſhing</hi> and <hi>amazing coming,</hi> and <hi>humblings</hi> of the Lord Chriſt, all his abaſings, the deepeſt that ever were; all of eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally his ſufferings, his agony, apprehenſion, and by betraying, his arraignment, condemnation, deriſion, buffeting, ſpittings on, ſcourging, and crucifying, with the weight of the wrath of God, and his with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing for a time, and then giving up the ghoſt. All theſe <hi>unparallel'd Sufferings</hi> from <hi>moſt inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable</hi> love. Lay this great <hi>abaſing</hi> home to greatly humble thee; This <hi>ſoul</hi> exceeding heavineſs, to work thee to ſuitable ſorrow; this <hi>Blood</hi> ſo precious, to <hi>warm thy heart,</hi> to melt it, and work it to willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to leave this ſin, that more peculiarly ſpilt it; this blood of God, and his life that he <hi>laid down</hi> for it; to thy <hi>free laying down</hi> of it, of this peculiar Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>killing ſin.</p>

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:47560:176"/>thee, that haunt thee, that thou haſt no freedom or quiet, that <hi>ſtorm thee</hi> ſo violently, thou knoweſt not what to do.</p>
               <p>After peace and aſſurance is obtained, and power alſo in ſome good degree gained, the Lord ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lets Satan looſe, in ſeveral ways, he in infinite wiſdom judges fitteſt for moſt holy purpoſes, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to himſelf and his own glory, for moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ends, as reſpecting his own children, their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual great good. If thy caſe be thus to be tempted, it <hi>may be very ſorely aſſaulted:</hi> Conſider that now thou art not to be <hi>ſcared and diſturbed,</hi> as at a ſtrange thing, unuſual with Gods Children, though new to thee.</p>
               <p>Thou art not to be <hi>ſadned and dejected</hi> with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and diſcouragement, not <hi>diſturbed</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, as neither heart, nor head, reſolution or reaſon, grace or experience, counſel, or any thing can help, and be effectual.</p>
               <p n="1">1. But now, one excellent and proper way in this caſe of ſudden diſturbances, from ſudden aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, is a turning from thy <hi>imaginations,</hi> thy <hi>ſudden</hi> and <hi>ſhort thoughts</hi> that are <hi>raiſing hurries,</hi> violent paſſions, and diſturbances in thee; to endeavour <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and deliberate thinkings,</hi> to do what in us lyes, to check <hi>imagination</hi> and phanſie, and haſty appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions thence flaſhing, and flying like ſparks from a blazing matter; and to let the <hi>Sun-ſhine of reaſon,</hi> ſerious and <hi>religious reaſon,</hi> put out the <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles</hi> of phanſies and imaginations; to quench and ſlack their heat and haſte. There is <hi>nothing</hi> our fooliſh hearts are apter unto, then theſe <hi>ſhort ſudden</hi> thoughts, flaſhes, and haſtineſs, without <hi>heedings</hi> and ſtay.</p>
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:47560:176"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Haſtineſs of thinking</hi> comes on us as Lightning ſometimes on the dry <hi>thatcht houſe,</hi> ſets it inſtantly on fire, and comes as <hi>Lightning with an after Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-clap,</hi> ſtrikes all into fears and confuſion, ſhivers and ſcatters all confidence and conſideration, into ſuch confuſedneſs and diſcompoſure, that nothing at that time will prevail with us. Like the Sea, when a ſtrong wind hath raiſed the billows high, it rages and roars, and cannot ſuddenly reſt.</p>
               <p>The way in all caſes of troubles by <hi>ſudden appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions</hi> and ſhort thoughts, is to help our ſelves by thoughts of <hi>depth</hi> and <hi>length. Depth of ſeriouſneſs,</hi> things ſoaking firſt into thy mind. <hi>Length</hi> alſo of abode and ſtaying with thee a <hi>fit ſpace of time,</hi> that allowance of time which a <hi>ſerious</hi> and weighty thing ought in full to have.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>relief of Temptations</hi> working diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing impreſſions, from Satans ſudden and thick dartings, and our ſudden receivings in imagination and ſhort thinkings, and thence coming quick upon the minds, paſſions, and affections, <hi>muſt be ejected by contrary ſeriouſneſs,</hi> and time-taking in thinking.</p>
               <p>Until we can in <hi>ſome ſort</hi> ceaſe to be <hi>ſudden, ſhort,</hi> and <hi>haſty</hi> in our apprehenſions, until <hi>phanſie</hi> and <hi>imagination</hi> ſway leſs, and <hi>judgment in ſeriouſneſs</hi> and pondering prevail more, that we are <hi>habited</hi> and accuſtomed to wiſely weigh things that come into our minds, Satan will be <hi>too hard</hi> for us, by <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our haſtineſs our hurt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was one reaſon of <hi>Davids</hi> miſcarriage, when he under temptation in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. he tells us, verſ. 11. <hi>He ſaid all men are lyars.</hi> But he found the reaſon, it was <hi>in his haſte.</hi> His being <hi>fail'd</hi> by the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was by the <hi>haſte</hi> of his ſpirit in <hi>imagination,</hi>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:47560:177"/>thought <hi>too ſhort,</hi> too ſudden, and paſſion was ſtirred too ſoon. He did not ponder what promiſe was, and the experiences he had to ſtay him. Thus the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> whom <hi>Satan winnowed;</hi> he <hi>came thick with his darts</hi> of temptation, <hi>Peter was too ſhort in conſideration,</hi> which made him ſo <hi>ſudden</hi> in fear, and that occaſioned his <hi>fall.</hi> If he had uſed ſuch conſideration, as led him to repent afterward, had uſed <hi>conſideration</hi> in the time of tentation, he had not been led into it.</p>
               <p>Thus Divines give the account of that <hi>fall</hi> that ruined <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity. He did not due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider; <hi>he acted imagination and incogitancy,</hi> not wiſdom and prudent pondering.</p>
               <p>This was one way the Apoſtle uſed in the caſe of temptation by affliction, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. They <hi>conſidered</hi> not, but were too haſty, too forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and therefore ſo diſcouraged at the Croſs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he endeavours to bring them to conſideration, to extinguiſh <hi>ſhort apprehenſion</hi> and ſudden thoughts which occaſioned fears and diſcouragement.</p>
               <p>This is a <hi>right way</hi> to relieve diſquiets from any ſudden imaginations, and from the ſubtil quick dartings of Satan. Let that which comes ſuddenly be thought on <hi>ſeriouſly,</hi> viewed over and over.</p>
               <p>Creatures <hi>apt to ſtart</hi> and fright, as Horſes young and of high metal, we bring them <hi>cloſe to the things</hi> they fright at, make them look on them oft, and touch them, that time and looking may teach them not to ſtart. If temptations were entertained not with <hi>ſudden ſhort thoughts</hi> and imagination; but with <hi>abode and ſeriouſneſs</hi> of thoughts in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this would much advantage us in times oftem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, and diſappoint Satans deſigns.</p>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:47560:177"/>
               <p n="2">2. And this leads us to <hi>another effectual way,</hi> and in part illuſtrates the former particular, namely, that help <hi>of diverting the mind,</hi> earneſtly ſtriving when ſuggeſtions and injections charge thee, to <hi>think</hi> quite another way. Take in <hi>good thoughts,</hi> and be as earneſt and intent as thou canſt, that Satan may ſee thou <hi>art not at leiſure,</hi> haft no mind to parley with him, there's no room for ſuch a gueſt, the door is barred againſt him.</p>
               <p>This is a good Rule in Reaſon, to make a <hi>diverſion</hi> of the thoughts; when any thing troubles us, and proves a diſturbance, a <hi>diverſion</hi> is the cure. When Satan comes, thou haſt ways <hi>enough</hi> for thy <hi>thoughts to divert</hi> by things of excellency in abundant variety, to <hi>entertain</hi> and <hi>detain</hi> with the higheſt pleaſure and ſatisfaction, thy moſt ſerious thoughts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But <hi>another help,</hi> and that our Lord Chriſt hath taught, when Satan would tempt him: <hi>flye up to Heaven by prayer,</hi> Mark 14.38. <hi>Pray that ye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not into temptation.</hi> When Hell riſes up, arms and charges againſt thee, this is ever a ready help, to flye up to heaven, <hi>to charge him,</hi> complain of him, and call for the help that's <hi>ſtronger</hi> than Satan, the <hi>mighty Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> againſt that malicious Spirit. Prayer is a both <hi>rare diverſion</hi> of thoughts, and <hi>a piece of Artillery</hi> that will do execution moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and never fail, if in faith and fervency. He fears nothing more than <hi>prayer,</hi> and <hi>feels</hi> nothing more. If he can diſcourage prayer, he triumphs. But as our Lord, when in <hi>an agony he prayed more fervently,</hi> and <hi>had an Angel ſent from Heaven to ſtrengthen him:</hi> So if thou art in an agony, a ſad buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feting of Satan, <hi>pray more fervently,</hi> and <hi>an Angel from Heaven,</hi> yea the God that is the ſtrengthner will help <hi>againſt this Angel from Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:47560:178"/>
               <p>Meditation in this caſe of Temptation muſt be ordered by <hi>Scripture-rules,</hi> by having ſuch apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Satan and his temptations, as the Scriptures (which hold forth the ſure Notions and Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of things concerning our ſpiritual ſtate and affairs) as that teacheth. Ah! when we are <hi>guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our own Notions</hi> and conceits, Satan will be too hard for us by his ſubtilties, methods, depths, and deeeits, which he hath and practiſeth. He can <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit us, far out-reaſon us,</hi> when we have never ſuch <hi>parts and perfections of reaſon</hi> and learning, and all <hi>humane accompliſhments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when we take the Scriptures for our <hi>only rule,</hi> then have we <hi>the moſt ſure and ſupereminent wiſdom,</hi> the <hi>infinite wiſdom</hi> of a God againſt the <hi>narrow</hi> wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of a creature, the <hi>infallible wiſdom</hi> of a God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>falſhoods and lyes</hi> of a creature. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.16. The Apoſtle bids <hi>take the ſhield of faith to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.</hi> No ſhield is proof, and large enough to cover us, and quench his fiery darts: But that of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Faith in the Scriptures, <hi>held forth by the grace of Faith</hi> in the holy heart; this will do it.</p>
               <p>This was the way <hi>the Captain of our Salvation</hi> uſed when Satan <hi>ſo boldly</hi> tempted him. He might have dealt <hi>divers ways</hi> with him, and at firſt ſight daſht him. He might have told him, <hi>it would be utterly</hi> in vain to tempt him; It <hi>was impoſſible for him</hi> to prevail; <hi>chid him</hi> for his audaciouſneſs, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault the Son of God. <hi>Reaſoned with him,</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted him</hi> quite down. <hi>Ruled him,</hi> and <hi>commanded him</hi> out of his preſence ſo pure and glorious, as he ſo often afterward rebukt him, reſtrained him, and diſpoſſeſt him out of ſo many.</p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:47560:178"/>
               <p>But he only lookt to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> uſed and held forth the Scripture, and nothing is recorded elſe. <hi>Three darts</hi> the Devil throws, <hi>three different tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> he uſes. Thoſe three ſome of the Learned, (which in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.16. are called the <hi>All in the world</hi>) 1. Senſuality, in that, <hi>Make theſe ſtones bread,</hi> to feed thee. 2. Pride, in that, <hi>Caſt thy ſelf down,</hi> to preſume proudly. 3. Covetouſneſs, in that, <hi>All theſe will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</hi> He tempts him to covet all the Kingdoms of the world, contrary to contentedneſs with his preſent poor condition. But the three darts of temptation are quencht with the uſing a <hi>threefold Scripture;</hi> ſo Satan is diſappointed, and goes away ſhamefully beaten. Beaten <hi>by only uſing</hi> this Weapon of the Word. The Word muſt be thy help in all caſes of temptation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Word as thy only <hi>ſure directive</hi> and guide for all right conceiving of Satan and his temptings.</p>
               <p>We muſt not <hi>miſ-apprehend, miſ imagine</hi> Satan and his workings. As we muſt not <hi>frame any falſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations</hi> of the moſt bleſſed God, ſo we ſhould not frame in our minds <hi>any falſe imaginations</hi> of Satan and his temptings of us. But this we do, and muſt do, when imagination goes alone, and takes not the Rule of Scripture, <hi>but takes</hi> the fond and feeble principles of a <hi>dark</hi> and deceitful, and of a <hi>daſtardly</hi> and ſlothful ſpirit, loth and unfit to combat. <hi>The Notions and diſcoveries of Scripture are our ſure way of help.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As what the Scripture <hi>infallibly manifeſts</hi> Satan to be; as to his nature, he is a Spirit, <hi>but not a God.</hi> He is exceeding <hi>wiſe</hi> by nature, crafty and very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til by long improved experience, <hi>but infinitely</hi> (O
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:47560:179"/>Chriſtian) below thy God. Though he <hi>hath a depth</hi> of policy; yet he hath not the <hi>Maſter-reach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though he hath a <hi>very extenſive</hi> and an abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing experimental knowledge in many things, and knows men, and <hi>much of particular perſons,</hi> can look far into them, yet hath he not the advantages which the <hi>Heart-maker,</hi> and the <hi>Heart-ſcarcher, Jer.</hi> 17.10. and the <hi>Heart-knower,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.30. the only Heart-knower. He cannot ſee with <hi>any direct look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on,</hi> and <hi>into any heart;</hi> but he ſees by <hi>an indirect eying,</hi> gueſſing and gathering by <hi>circumſtances,</hi> and <hi>going by conſequences,</hi> and not by infallible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Both indirectly and imperfectly alſo it is he knows any heart, and the workings of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As <hi>to his power,</hi> though he be mighty in ſtrength to make <hi>impreſſions</hi> upon elementary natures, and <hi>things belonging</hi> to men, as houſes, goods, cattel, any enjoyments of ſuch a ſort; and <hi>upon bodies</hi> and lives of men, when <hi>God pleaſes</hi> to permit him, as we have it moſt evidently in the 1. &amp; 2. of <hi>Job;</hi> yet he hath not <hi>ſuch power</hi> to work upon the ſouls of men, as to <hi>deſtroy them,</hi> or to diſturb them, or to diſcern and diſcover their hearts, their <hi>thinkings, affectings, aimings,</hi> or any actings of the reaſonable ſoul. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he <hi>hurt the ſoul,</hi> either to deſtroy it, or to <hi>defile</hi> it, or to <hi>force</hi> it, to think, or affect, or purpoſe. He can <hi>force no man to ſin,</hi> in the leaſt <hi>commiſſion</hi> of evil, or <hi>omiſſion</hi> of good.</p>
               <p>He cannot <hi>perſwade,</hi> terrifie, or trouble, without firſt our giving leave, and giving way. He gets ground by our <hi>firſt giving ground;</hi> he leads when we <hi>let him faſten his chain,</hi> and draws when we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our ſelves to be drawn. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own luſt, and is enticed.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:47560:179"/>
               <p>Satan <hi>caſts forth the bait,</hi> but we <hi>firſt catch it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> he catcheth us; he cannot <hi>make us</hi> take in the bait, no more than the <hi>Fiſher</hi> can force the fiſh to bite and ſwallow his bait; he <hi>tenders</hi> only, and the <hi>fiſh</hi> takes it of its own accord.</p>
               <p>Satan can <hi>throw</hi> his dart, but it <hi>cannot enter,</hi> unleſs we will; if we will <hi>yield,</hi> and not encounter with our arms, but walk unweaponed, and not fight.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though Satan hath the <hi>greateſt gall,</hi> deepeſt, and moſt highly improved hatred, of an <hi>irreverſible edge,</hi> boiled up to the higheſt <hi>Hell-dyed implacable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> yet this Serpent is not ſo formidable, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite love of God to thee is <hi>comfortable.</hi> What can his <hi>malice</hi> weigh againſt the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of thy God that endureth continually?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though Satan be unweariedly buſie and ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, yet he is not, cannot be ſo <hi>induſtrious,</hi> careful, wakeful, working for thee, and diſpoſing all things for thy greateſt good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. as thy God is. He never can <hi>out-do thy God,</hi> his doings againſt thee, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>out-do</hi> thy Gods doings for thee: No not in any <hi>heat</hi> or height of any temptation.</p>
               <p>When he tempts thee, buffets thee, haunts thee, he <hi>muſt not be lookt upon</hi> as one <hi>at full liberty</hi> to do what he liſts. He is not the <hi>Ruler</hi> of all things, governs not the world by himſelf alone. <hi>But he is under thy God then when he tempts thee;</hi> yea, thy God <hi>governs the very temptation.</hi> Satan can caſt out no more of his ſerpentine venom than <hi>thy God permits.</hi> He caſts not out one drop or the leaſt quantity, without thy Gods firſt giving way.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As thy God governs by ſtill giving Satan leave, and limiting him when he tempts, as he limited him in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe; ſo his <hi>letting Satan</hi> tempt, is not <hi>for
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:47560:180"/>him</hi> to have his will, but that thy God may have <hi>his own holy will,</hi> both to teach thee, and better thee much, to ſupport, encourage, and yet humble much thy ſpirit, that thy God ſees is needful for thee.</p>
               <p>Though temptations are like fire to <hi>melt</hi> the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, yet not to <hi>mar,</hi> but mend it, to purge it, caſt it into a new mould, that it may be poliſht and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſo fitted more for thy Gods praiſe.</p>
               <p>Though the <hi>beſt Phyſicians</hi> ſometimes <hi>uſe ſevere</hi> and ſharp remedies; yet the trouble, pain, ſickneſs cauſed by Evacuations, Corroſives, Cauſticks, Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and ſuch like, are not intended for themſelves, but for recovery, ſoundneſs, ſtrength, and the good of the Patient, though at preſent he may not ſo like or believe it. So is it in thy Gods ſuffering thee to be tempted ſorely, and long buffeted; and this muſt be conſidered and believed. Thy Gods ſuffering thee to be tryed, is <hi>only for gracious ends,</hi> which after the <hi>temptation</hi> is well over, will clearly be ſeen, and thankfully acknowledged.</p>
               <p>Ah! thou wilt ſay, <hi>I could not have</hi> been without this temptation, or theſe tryel, in this <hi>nature, manner, me ſure, ſo ſharp, ſo long, ſo many.</hi> Never had my <hi>experiences</hi> been ſo rich, my <hi>Faith</hi> and truſt, love and cleaving, hope and waiting, humility, patience, courage, contentedneſs, and other graces ſo appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo improved, <hi>acted ſo high,</hi> to the praiſes of God, and reflected and brought in ſuch peace and joy to my own boſom. Ah! how out of this evil God hath wrought my good? Out of this roaring Lyon this <hi>eater brought meat, out of the ſtrong ſweetneſs, as</hi> Samſon <hi>of the honey found in the Lyon he vanquiſht, Judg.</hi> 14.8.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Though Satan be ſuch an <hi>enemy,</hi> and his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtations
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:47560:180"/>ſo great; yet <hi>Meditation</hi> muſt gather up the <hi>reliefs</hi> and encouragements the Scripture ſupplies thee with. All diſcouragement ariſes much from a <hi>ſingle,</hi> or too much pondering and poring on a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent evil, <hi>without</hi> a due looking to the means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, eſcaping, or enduring. Therefore Meditation here muſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Eye God as well as Satan,</hi> his love, faithfulneſs, pity, power, and all things making for comfort. 2. The purchaſe of Chriſt buying victory by his blood. 3. The preſence and help of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit againſt the evil Spirit, and the defence he will be ſure to make of his own houſe and Temple, and the things of it, to ſave it from harm.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Laſtly, thy Meditation muſt <hi>look up,</hi> and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to write after the copies of the Saints, that have <hi>couragiouſly</hi> combated, and <hi>gloriouſly</hi> conquered, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially upon thy <hi>Captain</hi> General, who overcame not by his meer <hi>infinite</hi> power; but by means at hand, and ready <hi>always</hi> in thy power. By the Scripture I have ſingled out <hi>a few things</hi> on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; whole books, ſome leſs, ſome very great have been written very learnedly and experimentally of the Doctrine of Temptations, wherein large dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and help may be had for ſuch as are tempted; but I have rather exceeded already, and therefore will add no more in this particular.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Some Directions as to occaſional and ſet Meditation.</head>
               <p>SOme Directions might be next inſerted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that Meditation uſed <hi>on ſpecial occaſions,</hi> and which is more therefore ſolemn, and at larger leiſure. As in the Law, beſides the daily Sacrifices, there were particular <hi>ſolemn times,</hi> where the work was much more; <hi>more Sacrifices</hi> offered, <hi>more Rites</hi> obſerved, and time ſpent in thoſe Services was more. This Meditation muſt be performed according to the nature and ſcope, and ſuch Rules as beſt godly wiſdom can ſuggeſt for it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As choice of the <hi>fitteſt ſeaſon</hi> and opportunity, doing it when we are <hi>freeſt</hi> from avocations, and <hi>fitteſt</hi> as to frame, temper, and ſtrength of body; when we are <hi>livelieſt and freſheſt,</hi> and not ſunk, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, diſpirited; that the good and <hi>lively</hi> preſent temper of body may the better help and aſſiſt the ſoul, and the ſoul thereby more orderly and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, more <hi>intenſly and deliberately</hi> act.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chuſing the <hi>fitteſt place,</hi> is a prudence and great advantage for avoiding <hi>diſturbance</hi> and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; and to have the <hi>golden thread of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> run ſmoothly on without breaking from any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions. <hi>We muſt in faithfulneſs</hi> to our own <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual intereſt;</hi> wiſely watch, and ſtrongly reſolve to put by every thing that may divert or diſquiet us in our now intended Meditation.</p>
               <p>A <hi>darkſom place,</hi> or that is purpoſely made ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:47560:181"/>dark for avoiding diſtractions from the eye, and to be better <hi>compoſed,</hi> more ſerious and intent, is a good furtherance to Meditation, if we are not timorous, and apt to fright. <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 24.63. <hi>went out in the evening to Meditation.</hi> It may be the duskiſhneſs of the time might be <hi>part of his purpoſe,</hi> becauſe he could leſs ſee about, which the <hi>lightſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the day would not ſo ſuit.</p>
               <p>All things which prevent <hi>ſcatterings of the thoughts,</hi> and <hi>abate ſeriouſneſs,</hi> which may <hi>conduce to intending</hi> the mind, and quicken to the duty in hand, ſhould <hi>ſo well as we can,</hi> be conſidered and applied, until by <hi>frequent practice,</hi> we get <hi>a hand at this work,</hi> that thou <hi>proveſt an Artiſt</hi> in it, and <hi>arriveſt at a heavenly habit,</hi> to work readineſs, eaſineſs, and conſtancy in doing it.</p>
               <p>The Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 108.1. ſaith, <hi>His heart was ready,</hi> ſo the old Tranſlation hath it; the new Tranſlation, <hi>My heart is fixed.</hi> The word in the Hebrew ſignifies <hi>firſt ready</hi> or prepared. Then <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly</hi> it ſignifies fixed. We firſt fit, prepare a thing, ſharpen it before we drive it into the ground, and then drive it in and fix it. So act ſeriouſly and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that thy heart may be ready, and may alſo be fixt, and this by a <hi>habit</hi> which brings readineſs and fixedneſs, as in other holy duties, ſo in this of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of Directions, in reference to ſhort and ejaculatory Meditations.</head>
               <p n="1">1. HEed here muſt be taken, <hi>that neither</hi> theſe ſhort and quick actings of the ſoul in ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations <hi>Prove excluſive of the more ſerious and ſolemn,</hi> or <hi>take off from it,</hi> from <hi>either the daily Meditation,</hi> or <hi>the ſolemn occaſional</hi> formerly ſpoken of: Nor that <hi>we lay more ſtreſs</hi> upon <hi>theſe ſhort and frequent dartings</hi> up of the heart, than upon our daily Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or the other; that this ſhort thing be not made <hi>to ſtand for all, or almoſt all elſe meditating.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The heart of the beſt perſon, is a <hi>deceitful</hi> and ſlippery, an <hi>inconſtant and fickle,</hi> a dull and ſlothful piece, <hi>under a lothneſs</hi> to do good, eſpecially that which is high and hard, <hi>that comes not off</hi> eaſily, and that which muſt have time, a ſpace, and good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of time. This we are ready, at leaſt in our hearts, to call <hi>tedious,</hi> and think too long; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be but <hi>bare allowance</hi> of ſo much time as the very neceſſity, for the well-doing the duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. As naturally a <hi>ſlightneſs</hi> and ſhortneſs to have a ſerious duty quickly over, pleaſes much; ſo a <hi>tang</hi> of this, yea too much of this <hi>carnal haſtineſs</hi> is in the beſt. Any ſpiritual performance we would <hi>oft</hi> have over before <hi>it be on,</hi> and get into the heart, before it be warm in the heart, kindle it, quicken it, draws it up to Heaven, and hath its efficacy and real ends.</p>
               <p>Things that are <hi>hard,</hi> and work <hi>trouble,</hi> we are ready quickly to call tedious, and becauſe other <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:47560:183"/>may call <hi>loud,</hi> our corruption <hi>preſent</hi> hath an <hi>itch</hi> for any duties being over, <hi>ended ſo ſoon as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore thou muſt look this ſhort, ſooner over work, <hi>get not ground</hi> of the other more ſerious and ſolemn Meditation; <hi>that a help</hi> convert not <hi>it ſelf into a hindrance;</hi> that it <hi>juſtle</hi> not out the ſolemn, or rob it of its due.</p>
               <p>Holy duties are to be all <hi>Links of the ſame golden Chain, Pearls</hi> all <hi>ſtrung upon the ſame ſilken thread;</hi> the <hi>greater</hi> muſt not keep off the leſs, nor the <hi>leſs</hi> the greater: Both muſt have their juſt allowance of place, come all <hi>upon</hi> the thread, make up the chain entire, and be all our helps in their <hi>connexion.</hi> Holy duties muſt not claſh, not be their <hi>own hinderers</hi> by oppoſition, one ſet againſt another; or <hi>derogating</hi> one from another. But as the <hi>noble parts</hi> in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the <hi>meaner parts,</hi> have all their ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, offices, uſes for the good of the whole; yet with <hi>their diverſity act not contrariety,</hi> but <hi>a ſweet harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious ſubſerviency</hi> mutually to each other, and to the whole.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither muſt this ſort of Meditation be <hi>ſlight</hi> and <hi>remiſs,</hi> grow into, and ſetle <hi>in a meer cuſtomari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and formality. It muſt not on the one hand <hi>ſhut out</hi> the more <hi>ſolemn</hi> Meditation; nor on the <hi>other hand</hi> fix in an eaſie and ſlight performing. But muſt have its true and <hi>ſpiritual, warm and lively acting</hi> with reverence, care, pure aiming, to have heart, for the ſhortneſs of time, to aſcend up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>making a ſhort viſit,</hi> for meeting with ſome ſoul-refreſhing, by a ſight and taſte of the pleaſures and delicacies <hi>ſet ready for all</hi> that travel this road of heavenly Meditation.</p>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:47560:184"/>
               <p>We muſt look it be a right work, how ſhort ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; that it be <hi>the uſe of our ſpiritual Archery,</hi> from a right principle, <hi>to take a true aim</hi> at the mark, flye round up to it, <hi>by acting</hi> ſpiritual skill and ſtrength, ſome wiſdom and warmth, <hi>as the nature of the work</hi> will admit.</p>
               <p>That it be not a <hi>flaſh, a fit of phanſie,</hi> a meer cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom which <hi>calls</hi> on us, and carries us, but a <hi>ſpark</hi> of the holy heart-fire within flying up to Heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This being <hi>a ſhort viſit</hi> made to Heaven, a journey of <hi>leſs charge</hi> and labour, and of a quick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch. It therefore ſhould be done the <hi>oftner,</hi> and with greater frequencies.</p>
               <p>From <hi>friends that are near,</hi> we expect more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent viſits. <hi>Common and eaſie things</hi> we look to be done more conſtantly to us. What thing in the world is ſo cheap as a thought? What is ſo ſhort, and of ſo quick a diſpatch?</p>
               <p>A <hi>thought-viſit</hi> is the <hi>eaſieſt viſit.</hi> God expects of us it ſhould be <hi>frequent,</hi> very oft; and reaſon urges to a greater frequency, for making up that which this ſort of Meditation muſt want of the more ſet and ſolemn.</p>
               <p>As they ſay of gold, that it is found either in the Oar mixt, or in the lump and ſmall pieces (Pipins as they call them) but purer, or elſe in ſand and ſmall duſt, very pure and good. But the ſmall golden ſands, when they are many gathered, and put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may make ſo large quantities for uſe, as that is found in the Oar, or lump and greater pieces.</p>
               <p>Many <hi>golden ſands</hi> of precious ejaculations will amount to much, and help to make a Chriſtian rich at laſt. Though <hi>great gains</hi> in trade fill the purſe ſooner, when ordinary; yet light gains when thick,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:47560:184"/>will make a heavy purſe alſo at laſt. I will add no more Directions for younger Chriſtians in their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, having already exceeded. Now we muſt come to Directions for others.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Directions for more grown and elder Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</head>
               <p n="1">1. YOu muſt <hi>daily contend</hi> to better eſtabliſhment and confirmation in this way and work of Meditation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.15. <hi>I will meditate in thy precepts;</hi> and verſ. 18. <hi>I will meditate, &amp;c. David</hi> had <hi>formerly meditated,</hi> accuſtomed himſelf to this rare practice, was not now to begin to reſolve or do. Therefore <hi>his meaning muſt be</hi> a fixing his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and purpoſe ſtronger. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> often for the eſtabliſhment of thoſe he wrote unto, prays earneſtly, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Stabliſh you in every good word and work,</hi> in every duty of godlineſs.</p>
               <p>The beſt Chriſtians, and moſt eſtabliſht in their way, have always need <hi>of more eſtabliſhing,</hi> as to their graces and frame of heart; ſo to their <hi>duties</hi> and whole courſe of godlineſs. There muſt be an earneſt care and ſtriving, as you have begun and practiſed, ſo to be ſtabliſhed. Not to begin, and then draw back, nor yield to do with a weakneſs, wearineſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenneſs; but here to ſay as <hi>David</hi> oft, <hi>O God my heart is fixed, I will meditate.</hi> Meditation is nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, but <hi>hard</hi> in it ſelf, comes off ſometimes har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The beſt heart is a <hi>ſlippery piece,</hi> that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:47560:185"/>not only flags and falls low, but ſometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo fails; the <hi>purpoſe</hi> within, and the <hi>practice</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out may have their ſtops and faltrings: The Watch may want a winding up. There may be failure in the practice, from a failing <hi>in the purpoſe,</hi> a fit of dying away may come upon thee, if there be not a conſtant care of ſtability.</p>
               <p>A good mans heart muſt be like <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple with the <hi>two Pillars ſet up</hi> in it, <hi>Jacin</hi> and <hi>Booz,</hi> eſtabliſhment and ſtrength.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As thou muſt endeavour eſtabliſhment, ſo ſtrive for <hi>improvement.</hi> Growth is neceſſary both in Graces and Duties, as the Scripture ſhews.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There muſt be care to improve in the Art and skill of <hi>holy Meditation.</hi> To underſtand thy way better, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.8. <hi>The wiſdom of the prudent is to underſtand his way;</hi> not only with an <hi>initial</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it, but a <hi>progreſſive</hi> underſtanding of it. Not only to know in the <hi>ſame degree,</hi> and to be always alike <hi>at the laſt</hi> as at the firſt, but to underſtand far better.</p>
               <p>As the wiſe Artificer that contents not himſelf with the ſame meaſure of skill in his way, but to be a <hi>better Artiſt,</hi> proceed to a perfection.</p>
               <p>If a Chriſtian be trading for Heaven in <hi>good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,</hi> he will ſtrive every way to excel.</p>
               <p>Not like a <hi>Bungler,</hi> that does in a poor pitiful manner, juſt to live and no more; but as an Artiſt, and <hi>man of ingenuity,</hi> to live plentifully.</p>
               <p>I muſt <hi>ſtudy how to ſtudy better,</hi> to comprehend the <hi>whole wiſdom</hi> of my way, to live more fruitfully to others, ſerviceably to God, comfortably to my own boſom.</p>
               <p>Not to only <hi>juſt ſo much skill</hi> as will ſerve to get <hi>creeping,</hi> but <hi>for flying to Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:47560:185"/>
               <p n="2">2. To learn how to <hi>kindle a fire</hi> in my heart, and do my work warmer.</p>
               <p>Strive to more <hi>affectionate Meditation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To have things have <hi>a quicker paſſage</hi> from the head to the heart.</p>
               <p>That the ſpiritual things meditated on, come <hi>ſooner to my heart,</hi> kindle it quickly, and make me all on fire. <hi>Bom.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not to be taken only for <hi>real fervency,</hi> but <hi>growth.</hi> He would not have them <hi>no warmer</hi> and fervent <hi>at laſt</hi> than at firſt: So Meditation ſhould <hi>heap hotter coals</hi> upon thee, make <hi>thy fire a flame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This by Meditations applying warmer, and more heart-<hi>quickning reaſons</hi> and arguments.</p>
               <p>We call motives (reaſons for doing a thing, a duty of Religion) Incentives. Meditation ſhould <hi>ſtrike fire,</hi> and blow it up into a flame.</p>
               <p>Strive to have Meditation more <hi>heart-warming;</hi> not only to have it more <hi>notional,</hi> but <hi>cordial;</hi> not only a ſhining, but a burning light, as it was ſaid of <hi>John Baptiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That's Meditation to purpoſe, when the <hi>head</hi> moves the heart, brings in light and heat alſo. The Moon-light is pleaſant, but the Suns is beſt, becauſe chiefly it is with <hi>vivifical heat,</hi> it is the worlds warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Therefore ſee, ſearch in Meditation for ſuch things, and manage them in ſuch a manner, as may warm thee <hi>at the heart</hi> moſt, make thee daily warmer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Warmer in that <hi>grand affection,</hi> that ſtrong ſpring of ſpiritual operation Love; love to the work of Meditation, love to heavenly and ſpiritual things, the lovely, beauteous, and glorious things which
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:47560:186"/>Meditation brings and ſets before thee, to <hi>highly treat and entertain thee.</hi> Principally moſt inflamed love to the <hi>higheſt beauty</hi> and glory, for whom moſt peculiarly that beſt affection, the <hi>beſt piece of thy heart</hi> was made, the moſt bleſſed God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Warmer <hi>in ardency of deſire,</hi> to keep in and improve in this heavenly way of Meditation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.20. <hi>My ſoul breaketh for the deſire it hath to thy judgments;</hi> which ſoul-breaking was for look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into them by reading, <hi>reading</hi> for meditating to preſent and ſupply new heavenly matter, that he might exerciſe himſelf there by Meditation, know Gods will, and be better affected, more reſolved and enlarged. That deſire ſo <hi>earneſt</hi> was greatly (among others) to be at that <hi>his rare mind-exerciſe of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the beſt way of thinking</hi> that poſſibly can be, none like this; this had this holy mans chief heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workings; nothing had that ſhare of conſtant ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; here were his longings to breathe his ſoul up this hill; he <hi>grudg'd</hi> the time that gave ſtop or interruptions to this beſt <hi>thought-work.</hi>

               <p>Something <hi>freſh,</hi> which may bring the better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourineſs and ſweeter reliſh, that may ſet a <hi>better edge,</hi> and quicken things more upon thee.</p>
               <p>Meditation, though it be not for <hi>feeding phanſie with curioſities;</hi> yet ſhould be ſo ordered, as to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ſweeten, ſuit and prepare things to <hi>more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> delight, and to a larger perceiving of that <hi>extenſive</hi> and abounding ſavourineſs and excellency in holy things.</p>
               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:47560:187"/>
               <p>Every Meditation ſhould endeavour <hi>a more exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite preparation,</hi> better ſtill reducing things that we ponder, both to ſpiritual <hi>advantages,</hi> with <hi>ſpiritual</hi> pleaſure accompanying.</p>
               <p>To do this <hi>moſt eaſily and effectually,</hi> our way is to improve and quicken Meditation <hi>by our gathering up</hi> the graciouſly afforded <hi>varieties</hi> of Scripture-paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges relating to thoſe things Meditation is to be upon, gather the varieties of Scripture-paſſages about that <hi>particular ſubject</hi> you mean to meditate on.</p>
               <p>The Scripture in the <hi>diverſities of paſſages</hi> about particular ſubjects, is like a rich banquet, where are ſet before thee great varieties of rarities: There are all manner of ſubjects. All the <hi>credenda</hi> and <hi>facienda,</hi> all things to be believed and practiſed in order to ſalvation. There are great varieties of heavenly <hi>Truths,</hi> for knowledge and wiſdom, and right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. Great varieties of <hi>Precepts,</hi> Rules, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for due practice. Many <hi>Promiſes</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Threatnings</hi> to back the Precepts; ſundry <hi>Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns</hi> and <hi>Precedents</hi> to aſſiſt them, and make them (and thereby) the Precepts more effectual on us.</p>
               <p>Oft in Scripture the ſame things are expreſſed in <hi>a various manner,</hi> in a different, <hi>a new mode and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,</hi> in <hi>new trimmings</hi> as it were, and new dreſſings, to both edifie and alſo pleaſe us. <hi>Variety in expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion carries oft variety of Notion,</hi> holds forth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to be learnt, and affords ſomething that may <hi>gratifie</hi> our ſpirits, as to pleaſure and delight.</p>
               <p>So the lame thing hath it may be <hi>varieties of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Reaſons</hi> for conviction and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Inducements</hi> to perſwade and lead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arguments</hi> and <hi>Inducements,</hi> with the <hi>higheſt Art</hi> of Reaſoning, with the <hi>beſt improvement</hi> of Rhetorick and Perſwaſion.</p>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:47560:187"/>
               <p>Thus if thou meaneſt to meditate upon God, or Jeſus Chriſt, or the Holy Spirit, upon Faith, or Love, or any Grace, upon any duty, any ſin, any affliction: Thy way is to ſee what the Scripture hath and holds forth in the ſeveral paſſages of it; as concerning Faith, of the <hi>Nature</hi> of it, of the <hi>effects</hi> and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it, <hi>priviledges</hi> coming by it, <hi>reaſons</hi> to perſwade to believe, to live by Faith in all conditions; how great <hi>variety</hi> of expreſſions have you for all things relating to Faith, ſo of other particular ſubjects?</p>
               <p>By this <hi>variety</hi> taking up one expreſſion after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at ſuch <hi>times as you can beſt,</hi> how may thy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation be <hi>carried on with great delight</hi> and to great advantage?</p>
               <p>This is one excellent way to order and improve thy Meditation, take <hi>varieties</hi> of Scripture-paſſages about any particular ſubject thou wilt meditate on.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For Scripture-<hi>expreſſion</hi> hath a bottom and foundation of ſure and infallible truth, which comes from God that cannot lye; <hi>your Meditation goes on ſure ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Scripture-expreſſions <hi>are ſuited for us</hi> by the ſo <hi>infinite wiſdom</hi> of a God, who knows how beſt to declare his own mind, and how beſt to <hi>convey</hi> and teach it to <hi>our capacity and condition.</hi> None can <hi>ſpeak ſo to me as God in the Scripture doth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Yea Scripture-expreſſions are <hi>ſanctified by God,</hi> to enable us to ſanctifie him in this and all other duties. This therefore is <hi>our beſt way</hi> to feed on theſe rarities, this rich banquet of ſo great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, when we are to meditate. Hereby we may ever have matter abundantly to meditate; <hi>never be to ſeek,</hi> and for the manner, perform it with great
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:47560:188"/>delight and pleaſure, which will otherwiſe be a wearineſs.</p>
               <p>This certainly <hi>was the way of the</hi> higheſt Artiſts in Meditation, <hi>David</hi> and other holy perſons upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in Scripture. They could not but <hi>ſee the ſame things to be repeated, yet oft in a various way of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> therefore muſt conclude, that the holy Inditer had his <hi>wiſe intendment</hi> in ſo various expreſſions. Therefore their <hi>godly</hi> wiſdom muſt teach them when they meditated, to go in that way the Spirits <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending intent</hi> led them: So let it be thy Rule, for thy <hi>help</hi> for to make thy Meditation pleaſurable and profitable together.</p>
               <p>I will mention ſome Inſtances.</p>
               <p>The Grace of Faith is thus variouſly expreſt.</p>
               <p>By <hi>truſting in God,</hi> Prov. 3.5. <hi>Truſt in the Lord with all thy heart.</hi> Iſa. 26.4. <hi>Truſt in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah;</hi> and in other places, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.5. <hi>By rowling our way on God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>taking hold of Gods ſtrength,</hi> Iſa. 27.5. and divers others: In reference to Chriſt, by <hi>ſeeing</hi> the Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.40. <hi>Coming</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. And <hi>believing</hi> on and in Chriſt often. Love of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Love thy God with all thy heart and with all thy ſoul.</hi> Deut. 6.5. <hi>Love thy God with all thy heart and ſoul;</hi> and a third is added, <hi>With all thy might. Mark</hi> 12.10. Chriſt adds to the three for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>With all thy mind.</hi> Certainly theſe varyings <hi>had their intent;</hi> were that when we meditate of theſe or other graces, we ſhould furniſh our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and improve by them.</p>
               <p>Thus things cited in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> are <hi>variouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt</hi> from thoſe very paſſages and particulars in the former Books: So the <hi>Chronicles</hi> expreſs differently
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:47560:188"/>things in the <hi>Kings,</hi> and the <hi>Four Evangeliſts</hi> vary the expreſſions of the ſame things, both the <hi>matters hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical</hi> and <hi>doctrinal;</hi> and all the Scripture over, this is practiſed. <hi>Variety of expreſſion calls for obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and holds forth oft ſome peculiar Notion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let this therefore be thy Rule in Meditation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be ſure frequently and earneſtly to meditate both of thy <hi>ſupreme and chief end,</hi> and of the proper and proportionate means thereto conducing. But do daily ſomething more to purpoſe in that great Meditation of the <hi>ſupreme end,</hi> as wiſdom teaches, and being that in its nature which deſerves the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and firſt things; that alſo which gives <hi>Rules</hi> to all thy other actings and endeavours, that glorifying &amp; exalting God above all. <hi>Do very much</hi> in collecting together, ſpreading before thee, well conſidering, acting the moſt <hi>vigorous and intenſe</hi> Meditation of all ſuch things which may reduce thee to <hi>higher appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, warmer affections,</hi> firmer reſolutions, and more earneſt and even <hi>contendings</hi> for glorifying him that is God, and there is none beſide him; for him that only gave thee <hi>thy all,</hi> body, ſoul, life, and only preſerves thy all. That <hi>gave his only Son</hi> to death, to ſave thy ſouls life. <hi>His Spirit to draw thee</hi> to Chriſt, or thou hadſt never come. <hi>To dwell and work in thee,</hi> and do all for thee, as to applying Chriſt, and all fellowſhip in Chriſt, and with him, and hath ſo infinitely obliged thee. Therefore how ſinful, how unworthy to not honour and glorifie him, how unkindly he takes it, and how it grieves him? Let Meditation gather up, and <hi>indusſtriouſly ſtrive</hi> to improve all it poſſibly can.</p>
               <p>Ah! how that holy Apoſtle was looking and
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:47560:189"/>ſtriving this way, <hi>how near was this</hi> glorifying God to his heart, how much in his eye and endeavour, how oft is he ſpeaking of it? How earneſtly doth he provoke all he had to do with, to it? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whatſoever ye do, if eat or drink, do all to the glory of God;</hi> acting all to it, muſt imply an always minding of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Lay <hi>ſound ſtreſs</hi> likewiſe in Meditation as to that thy <hi>next chief end ſelf-ſaving,</hi> to have more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts and induſtrious <hi>preſſings on hard to work it out, and make thy calling and election ſure.</hi> To work it out againſt all difficulties and oppoſitions, look more <hi>earneſtly</hi> up to Heaven, and into <hi>Heaven.</hi> And it is good when thou thinkeſt of Heaven; be then ſo bold with thy ſelf, and faithful to thy ſelf, as to lead thy thoughts to think of Hell, and ponder that place and ſtate, taking often the <hi>weight of the crown of glory,</hi> the <hi>worth</hi> of the Jewels of that Crown, and think in greater earneſtneſs of the Riches of that Kingdom of Glory, thy own <hi>unſpeakable happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> with that rare, rich, annexed Jewel <hi>Eternity.</hi> The loſing of it, is from not looking on it; moſt loſing it, from looking aſide to the world. The beſt <hi>go but ſlowly to Heaven,</hi> becauſe they mind it ſo remiſsly, and move ſo eaſily. A way, the beſt way to be the beſt <hi>Markſman</hi> at Heaven, ſhould be every Chriſtians great ſtudy. This is wiſdom for thy ſelf to meditate, <hi>ſtudy thy ſelf into the Art</hi> of winning the Crown of Glory. Weigh <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> unſpeakable, inſufferable, and eternal, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal torment and wo, with inconceivable and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, never fading happineſs and higheſt glory. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent more effectually, ſee, feel more <hi>ſenſibly</hi> the fearful and woful caſe of a <hi>damned</hi> ſoul, <hi>realize</hi> it
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:47560:189"/>with the beſt induſtry and Art thou canſt uſe; and be not <hi>ſo ſinfully ſoft, nice, and tender</hi> of touching, or of dwellings and ſearchings by this way of thoughts; <hi>force thy ſelf</hi> to feel the pains and ſcorchings of this Hell prepared, and the fulneſs of Gods wrath pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out; and then <hi>repreſent</hi> and realize to thy ſelf happineſs and glory, with thy <hi>utmoſt</hi> ability and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, as if thou ſaweſt it in all the fulneſs, taſted it, and wert feeding to the <hi>full</hi> at Chriſts Table in his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>ſtrange Artifices</hi> to get Crowns and Kingdoms. Ah! act Meditation into an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growing, more <hi>covetous</hi> of the gain, <hi>ambitious</hi> of the honour, <hi>contentious</hi> for to have the victory over all difficulties in the way of this moſt tranſcendent Crown of Glory.</p>
               <p>The wiſe Merchant ſeeks and buys the Pearl, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.46. The wiſe Meditater weighs, ſtrives for, and wins the Crown.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Improve Meditation all you can, as to the grand and moſt <hi>principal means,</hi> be very <hi>high and hard Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> for that <hi>excellency of knowledge, the knowledge of Chriſt, and him crucified,</hi> and better applying of him. To ſee daily more what a <hi>way</hi> Chriſt is to the Father, what <hi>fulneſs dwells in him, Col.</hi> 1.19. how freely he is offered, how <hi>mighty and ready he is to ſave to the uttermoſt.</hi> Uttermoſt of <hi>guilt,</hi> by righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and forgiveneſs; of <hi>wrath,</hi> by reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; of <hi>ſhame</hi> and vileneſs, by dignity and adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through his blood. To the uttermoſt of <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> by being our light; uttermoſt of our <hi>errours,</hi> by being put on as truth; uttermoſt of <hi>folly,</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applied as our wiſdom; uttermoſt of corrupt affections and carnal aims, choices and diſtempers
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:47560:190"/>of will, and finfulneſs of the whole ſoul, by being our <hi>ſanctification.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.31. Yea to the <hi>uttermoſt f all miſery,</hi> and to perfect felicity. Strive to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate better, to have Meditation iſſue in a <hi>growing knowledge</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>ſweeter ſavour,</hi> ſtronger <hi>recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bencies</hi> on him, <hi>larger receivings</hi> from him, more <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate fellowſhip</hi> with him, and a <hi>more worthy</hi> walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let thy Meditation be more improved in that particular of the <hi>great Applier</hi> of Chriſt to thee, and mighty Helper of thee, the holy Spirit; how to better entertain him, and by obeying, pleaſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light him, and not <hi>grieve him;</hi> that he always may be ready to aſſiſt, enlarge, and comfort thee, ſeal thee, and ſhed abroad the love of God in thy heart.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Strive after a <hi>better meditating</hi> on all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>promiſes,</hi> ſo as more to ſtrengthen Faith, heighten Hope, and have the fuller Communion with Chriſt by them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. So meditate of the <hi>Ordinances,</hi> as they be more highly valued and endeared, and be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental for thy meeting with God in them, and commanding his bleſſing by them, of light, warmth, ſtrength, and encouragement.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Mightily contend</hi> to exacter muſings and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings of thy <hi>hearts great wickedneſs</hi> and deep de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs. Make Meditation a <hi>better clue and thread</hi> to lead thee <hi>into all intricacies and windings</hi> of that maze and labyrinth wherein thou art ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be loſt, and art often loſt. To know it more perfectly in all its cheats and deceits, but with an earneſt looking up to God the heart-ſearcher, to manifeſt thy ſelf unto thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>So for the <hi>methods and dephts of Satan</hi> thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:47560:190"/>enemy, which will not be underſtood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſtudied and minded much. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>We are not ignorant,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>of his devices.</hi> He was not ignorant this way, this muſt be knowledge, by minding and ſtudying of them. Though God <hi>teacheth,</hi> yet not without our endeavour, ſetting our thoughts to ſearch and find out his practices and ſubtilties. If we are careleſs herein, God may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead <hi>of helping us againſt him,</hi> let him looſe upon us, to act his frauds and fury, that our <hi>buffetings</hi> may awaken us into mindings of him, and endeavours of being acquainted with his devices.</p>
               <p>Meditate therefore more to be an <hi>experienced skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Artiſt here, and grow more cunning to ſee into his practices.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Meditate more of <hi>that enemy the world,</hi> that makes the baits for <hi>covering Satans hooks,</hi> without which he could not ſo catch, as oft he doth; neither could we be <hi>ſo catcht from our own corruptions,</hi> if things of the world did not occaſion our deceivings. <hi>The fuel and tinder is without, the ſpark and fire is within; the luſt is within, but the bait is without.</hi> Jam. 1.14. <hi>Every one is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own concupiſcence and enticed.</hi> If the bait were nothing to us, there would be no catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us; if the world were <hi>vanity, all things as crucified to us,</hi> having no beauty and lovelineſs in them, there would be no danger.

               <p>But more particularly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THou muſt earneſtly act and ſtrive to improve thy Meditation on thoſe things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern thee in thy <hi>rank and age</hi> of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>There are ſome Babes, little children in godlineſs, others are young and ſtrong men, others are fathers, ſo 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.12, 13, 14. The ſtrong men muſt act according to their age and rank in Chriſtianity, <hi>not as babes</hi> or little children; the ſtrong Chriſtian muſt not, does not look to little childrens leſſons, return thither, and ſtrive to no more. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. <hi>To uſe milk,</hi> ſtick at barely the <hi>Principles of the Oracles of God</hi> and Doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>But uſes ſtrong meat,</hi> takes forth the higher leſſons in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, beyond children. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The word was in them, and they had overcome the wicked one.</hi> They were (beſides knowledge of the Principles) improved to ſuch knowledge of the Word, higher knowledge, that they knew what was proper of the Word, and how to uſe it, as fitted them, to combat with Satan, and overcome him. The ſtrong Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian muſt be buſied in <hi>higher matters;</hi> therefore muſt act Meditation higher, ſtudy and learn thoſe leſſons, not of the lower forms, but above them. To learn the <hi>Horn-book</hi> or <hi>Primmer,</hi> and keep there, learn no further, cannot become a grown man. A Chriſtian beyond a Babe, muſt feed above a Babe, a younger one, <hi>feed on ſtrong meat,</hi> muſt meditate higher, of <hi>growing</hi> in grace, <hi>mortifying</hi> corruptions which are
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:47560:191"/>riſing up; <hi>overcoming</hi> temptations when they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, come it may be thick and fierce. Afflictions that may charge ſmartly, and all ſuch leſſons which Scholars of a higher form in Chriſts School, are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſet to learn and take forth. Theſe thou muſt make thy ſtudy, thy <hi>peculiar Meditation,</hi> for finding out the beſt way of proceeding in theſe duties.</p>
               <p>The young weak Chriſtians, Chriſt ſets not them ſo <hi>high and hard tasks</hi> at their firſt entrance into his School, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.12. <hi>I have many things to ſay, but ye cannot bear them now.</hi> Higher matters of <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, harder</hi> matters of practice; but ſtronger Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians muſt have ſtronger meat, and ſtronger exerciſe alſo than Children and Novices. And this for <hi>Chriſts</hi> higher glory, the ſtronger Chriſtians greater improvement and encouragement. This muſt be thy <hi>now-way of Meditation,</hi> how to act higher in thy <hi>now higher rank.</hi> In a word, that thy knowledge, wiſdom, ſtrength, courage, all thy graces may be felt more vigorous and improving, be more evident and ſhining, and Chriſt in them for his glorifying.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Meditation, let it be managed for <hi>the beſt thou canſt,</hi> as to all particular caſes, and there <hi>ply moſt</hi> where thou haſt moſt preſſing need. Thus <hi>David</hi> and other holy ones of God endeavoured the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Meditation to that particular caſe which then concerned them, to beat out their beſt way of help, as oft in the Pſalms and other places, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52. of <hi>Doeg, Pſal.</hi> 63. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſes had their particular Meditations, as the titles of theſe Pſalms, or their matter ſhews.</p>
               <p>In a particular caſe, thou now (it may be) art put upon ſomething <hi>new to thee;</hi> here Meditation ſhould be uſed and continued for, and <hi>until a right
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:47560:192"/>and ſure way</hi> be diſcovered for thy beſt help; the <hi>true and ſure Scripture-way</hi> the Saints have gone and found relief in: As what <hi>Abraham</hi> in his tryals did, what <hi>Jacob,</hi> what <hi>Job,</hi> what <hi>David,</hi> what many others in the Old and New Teſtament did, our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord, his Apoſtles and Followers did.</p>
               <p>As in caſes of diſeaſes, dangers, troubles, a wiſe man will ſtudy <hi>the right means and manner</hi> how to be helpt. Thus in all caſes, <hi>eſpecially new tasks,</hi> tryals, troubles, and dangers, Meditation ſhould be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed according to the <hi>Scripture-directions</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples left us.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>very particular caſe,</hi> or kind of difficulty be not <hi>to be found</hi> in Scripture, then you muſt by your Meditation <hi>gather your direction by the Rule of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</hi> Look what was like it, look if there be not the ſame in kind; yet what is to be found as <hi>high</hi> and great, not inferior to thy caſe, if not <hi>higher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Thy particular caſe, it may be, is ſome <hi>prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> corruption, or that which ſtirs and much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles thee, which Chriſt ſuffers thee to be diſquieted by, ſometimes overcome with, <hi>to ſhew thee</hi> what is in thy heart, to humble thee, and what need thou haſt of his Spirit and Grace to help thee. Thus it was with <hi>Job, David, Jeremy,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some <hi>buffeting</hi> it may be of Satan, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Paul</hi> had it; ſo it may be thy temptation is <hi>high,</hi> it may be <hi>horrid</hi> againſt God, <hi>unnatural</hi> againſt others, againſt thy ſelf. This <hi>Chriſt in his wiſdom permits,</hi> for learning thee to be a good Champion for him, and to experience his ſuccouring and ſupporting of thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Or it may be ſome <hi>ſore and ſharp affliction,</hi>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:47560:192"/>ſome ſudden ſurpriſal, which muſt add to it, as a quicker fire, to refine thee the better.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It may be the <hi>caſe of deſertion,</hi> God withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hiding his face, leaving thee in the dark, as was <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.12. <hi>Reſtore to me the joy of thy ſalvation;</hi> of <hi>Aſaph, Pſal.</hi> 77.7. <hi>Will the Lord caſt off for ever,</hi> Pſal. 88. <hi>Hemans</hi> caſe. Look out and weigh what in theſe caſes the Saints did, and beat out thy way ſo well as thou canſt.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Thy ſetting Meditation on work for wiſdom in that <hi>great concern,</hi> of <hi>keeping thy heart with all diligence, Prov.</hi> 4.23. The <hi>Art of Heart-keeping,</hi> one of the greateſt skills; therefore for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it muſt have <hi>great ſtudy</hi> to be in ſome degree a <hi>Maſter in this Art,</hi> and be better in it. 1. Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to learn, <hi>thought-government.</hi> Other leſſons formerly took thee up more than keeping thy heart, than <hi>governing</hi> thy thoughts, which among other means muſt be, by 1. <hi>Conſidering</hi> the excellency of the thinking faculty in it ſelf. 2. The <hi>uſes</hi> it is for. 3. The <hi>poyſon of ſin</hi> that hath gotten up to thy <hi>head,</hi> and is occaſioning ſuch vain and vile thoughts, ſuch wildneſs, rovings, inconſtancies, and readineſs to multiply and fix upon either bad or by-things. 4. The <hi>neceſſity</hi> of reducing them, diſlodging them, thoſe vain and vile imaginations. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. <hi>How
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:47560:193"/>long ſhall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> ſaith God to the Jews. They ſhould neither <hi>lodge,</hi> as in wicked men, neither <hi>enter</hi> or <hi>ſtay in a good heart.</hi> 5. There ſhould be a coming to have, and <hi>improve in thee an habitual heavenly mindedneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Strong Chriſtians muſt have a <hi>power</hi> and <hi>rule</hi> over their thoughts, and not be ſatisfied without it in ſome ſort, remembring Gods pure omniſcient eye upon all the thoughts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. and his judging hereafter of them at the great day. 6. Thoughts are the ſouls <hi>inlet</hi> into the affections and will, the riſe of willing and affecting, and through them of acting and doing. They are very <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>nimble, yet can be very</hi> deep, intenſe, and ſerious; great reaſon therefore thou haſt to ſtudy, to meditate, to contend to the due regulation of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thy Meditation muſt engage in that <hi>hard leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> the <hi>way of ruling thy ſpirit,</hi> as to the affections, pondering and <hi>beating out,</hi> how to govern them. Among the Heathens, the Philoſophers and wiſe men had very <hi>rare Rules</hi> and excellent Sayings about the right ordering the affections: But while they beat the buſh, they loſt the bird. They had not the Word of God, they knew not Chriſt, nor ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Grace, whereby the wiſdom and only right principles of governing theſe ſo unruly affections, can be attained, and they tamed and tuned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The task is, how to take them off where they are miſplaced, and ſet them on right objects, off the things below, and upon the things above, where they are both <hi>rectified</hi> and <hi>elevated,</hi> and truly <hi>eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As how to take them off wrong objects, ſo <hi>to take them down,</hi> when they are <hi>too hot, high, violent, eager,</hi> to <hi>turn</hi> their edge.</p>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:47560:193"/>
               <p n="3">3. To <hi>ſtir them up,</hi> and make them move, that <hi>either</hi> would not move, or but <hi>ſlowly,</hi> move lazily, and not with that due, earneſt and expedite quick motion when they ought to do it.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>compriſe the whole Irregularity</hi> of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. The true and ſound cure muſt be well ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died: <hi>Although ſuch as are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts,</hi> Gal. 5.24. <hi>Quoad animi propoſitum &amp; cordis purificati principium,</hi> as to the inward living principle, and the real heart-pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, initially and gradually, in little degree (for that which is in no degree begun, is not a grain of muſtard, is nothing at all.) Though thoſe that are in Chriſt have crucified, as we ſaid, their carnal affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in ſome degree: Coming in of Chriſt and Grace into the heart, gives the carnal affections a deadly daſh, like the taking of ſome incurable poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon given to kill <hi>gradually.</hi> The firſt taking gives the advantage for deaths ſeizing; yet this is not enough, as experience ſadly ſhews: there muſt be a <hi>ſtudying</hi> and great pondering, how to rule the <hi>daily diſcovered</hi> unrulineſs of the affections, and how to cure them, which is not the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> way, nor the <hi>wiſe moral</hi> mans way, which is to <hi>curb</hi> and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate them; but the Scriptures <hi>directed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> way; and therefore the Chriſtians way that he muſt uſe, and that is to crucifie and mortifie them. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Mortifie your affections that are on the earth.</hi> The Art and ſure way for carnal affections, as ſo, and then to <hi>ſtudy to order</hi> theſe affections which are noble natural plants, and diſpoſitions of heart, that they may be acted by graces principle on, and for things heavenly, with a <hi>real warmth</hi> and a <hi>growing fervency.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:47560:194"/>
               <p n="3">3. Strongly thou muſt <hi>reſolve,</hi> and moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely endeavour to ſtudy and meditate for the <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> of thy will. The <hi>will in its nature</hi> and rank is a moſt noble faculty, the <hi>Empreſs</hi> of the ſoul, the <hi>ſpring</hi> of action, the <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>biaſs</hi> for motion, the <hi>door</hi> that opens and admits in chuſing, or ſhuts out in refuſing; that which <hi>ſets up</hi> the mark and aim, every end and intereſt, and likewiſe <hi>makes choice</hi> or rejections of the <hi>means</hi> to the end. In its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and carnal ſtate, it is the <hi>wickedeſt piece</hi> in every perſon; it ſets up the greateſt Idol in the world; <hi>Self,</hi> in the Throne above God. Nothing in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath ſo <hi>great, frequent,</hi> and <hi>high complaints</hi> and charges brought in by God againſt it, that which is the moſt <hi>helliſh</hi> and <hi>deviliſh</hi> piece in its <hi>repugnancy, contrariety, ſtoutneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſtubbornneſs</hi> againſt God, and whatever is holy; and the helliſh <hi>hold-faſt of evil,</hi> chiefly when it receives the <hi>grain-colour</hi> and <hi>ſcarlet-tincture of habit</hi> by cuſtomary ſinning.</p>
               <p>In hearts <hi>changed by grace,</hi> it is in a great meaſure ſtill <hi>carnal,</hi> and accordingly in part hath all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned wickedneſs, and is ready to act it, if it be not the <hi>better watcht</hi> and ordered continually.</p>
               <p>Being then in the beſt men ſo evil, it needs the <hi>beſt ſtudy,</hi> the moſt ſerious and conſtant Meditation to find the beſt way for it, to rule this unruly will. 1. Eſpecially as to <hi>baſe ſelf-aims,</hi> in which it is the <hi>moſt ſlippery,</hi> and ſooneſt ſwayed, <hi>haſtily burried,</hi> and entangled. 2. And as to the <hi>curſed contrariety</hi> and helliſhneſs againſt the Law, will, ways of God, and God himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Art of <hi>ruling this Ruler in chief, is well worth thy chiefeſt Meditation;</hi> the wretchedneſs of it will diſquiet; the <hi>pliantneſs</hi> and obedience, holineſs and
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:47560:194"/>purity of its aims, choices, and refuſals will comfort moſt, as <hi>carrying higheſt evidences</hi> of thy ſincerity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Meditation hath great need to act its <hi>part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly</hi> and accurately, as <hi>to know how to govern the tongue,</hi> that rare inſtrument, called by <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 188.1. <hi>his glory.</hi> But by ſin, called by the Apoſtle, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.8. <hi>An unruly member, full of deadly poyſon, that ſets on fire the courſe of nature, is ſet on fire of Hell, verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>David</hi> prays for a watch before his mouth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.1. <hi>I ſaid I will take heed that I ſin not with my tongue, and keeping his mouth with a bridle.</hi> To refrain <hi>evil words,</hi> requires care; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain vain and <hi>idle words,</hi> requires a <hi>curioſity</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs.</p>
               <p>Study this Art, not as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> the Philoſophers Scholars, that had their <hi>quinquennium ſilentium,</hi> firſt ſpent five years in his School to learn ſilence, but all a <hi>mans life</hi> is too little. But there's more to be learnt than juſt ſilence, and that is <hi>ſavourineſs</hi> of ſpeaking. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.20. <hi>The tongue of the juſt is as choice ſilver; the heart of the wicked is little worth:</hi> then and therefore the tongue of the wicked <hi>is little worth,</hi> becauſe the <hi>heart, out of whoſe abundance the mouth ſpeaketh,</hi> is little worth.</p>
               <p>Study the Art of <hi>ſavoury ſpeaking,</hi> by getting three things. 1. A <hi>good treaſure</hi> in thy heart. 2. A <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> to diſcern times of ſpeaking. 3. A <hi>true, godly, humble boldneſs</hi> to ſpeak, and not be aſhamed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.46. <hi>I will ſpeak of thy teſtimonies before Kings, and will not be aſhamed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meditate for the true Scripture-way for ſpeaking.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Meditate how as to <hi>fill up with heart-beauties</hi> of graces within, knowledge, wiſdom, holineſs, and every particular grace, ſo to have <hi>a fruitful, ſhining,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:47560:195"/>exemplary</hi> converſation ſuitable to thy rank and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>How to <hi>walk worthy of the Lord to all well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, Col.</hi> 1.11. To all fruitfulneſs in every good work, in all conditions, and in all <hi>relative duties,</hi> as husband or wife, parent or child, maſter or ſervant, and the reſt. It is <hi>hard</hi> to be good indeed, <hi>harder</hi> to be growing better; <hi>hard</hi> to become and ſuit a change in condition never under before, hard to come up to relative duties, and be Chriſtian in them, and ſo good as a well-grown Chriſtian ſhould be. <hi>Some are very heedleſs here, they too little mind a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate growth herein,</hi> as in other parts of godlineſs; but this muſt be minded. Meditate <hi>univerſal growing,</hi> how to honour thy longer ſtanding in godlineſs, by ſhooting up and ſpreading out more.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly, Make it thy <hi>great ſtudy,</hi> how to have ſuitably to thy <hi>rank</hi> in godlineſs a richer treaſury and ſtock of <hi>experiences,</hi> uſeful and rare experiences for thy own and others advantage; make Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a <hi>great obſerver,</hi> a <hi>diligent gatherer,</hi> a <hi>careful layer up</hi> of experiences choice and precious, to have a large treaſury, to bring <hi>out of it new and old.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. FOr ſuch as are <hi>Chriſtians of the higheſt form</hi> in Chriſts School, ſuch the Apoſtle in this, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.13. calls <hi>Fathers;</hi> not for their long living here, or being long Chriſtians, viſible Members of the Church, as for <hi>great growth</hi> and improvement in real godlineſs; much Knowledge, Wiſdom, Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, Faith, Love, and Eminencies of Chriſtianity: their Meditation like the higheſt Artiſts, muſt be act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed higher.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Meditation of ſuch as are fathers, ſhould <hi>carry higher</hi> in all the ways, and concerning all the ſeveral points and particulars formerly expreſt, and relating to all perſons in general, in all the ſorts of Meditation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the <hi>daily Meditation,</hi> to be more eminently exerciſed and conſtant, in <hi>drawing out</hi> a thread of far exacter evenneſs and equality, without ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>breakings off,</hi> and <hi>inconſtancies</hi> that younger Chriſtians more unprincipled and unpractiſed, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ones not ſo enricht with a ſtock of grace, uſually fail in.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In this daily Meditation, to be more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently <hi>skilful</hi> and <hi>wiſe,</hi> like an <hi>old eminent Artiſt</hi> that takes up his work, and performs it with rare skill and dexterity, and little or no ſtudy, acting out of a habit excellently, without being to ſeek, raw at his work, or <hi>awk-handed,</hi> as imperfect Artiſts are. An
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:47560:196"/>old <hi>Bungler</hi> is a ſhameful ſight; but an <hi>old rare rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Artiſt</hi> is glorious.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To be more <hi>abundantly warm</hi> and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, acting with greater fervour, in a ſtronger ſtream of <hi>purer love,</hi> higher flame of all holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>aims more ſpiritual,</hi> and richer proportions of all the ingredient aſſiſtant graces required. You muſt be herein (as a Meditation ſo important) an <hi>out-doer</hi> of ſuch, as are in the ranks below thee; <hi>and of thy own former attainments</hi> and actings, making ſure to do in ſome degree <hi>ſuitable</hi> to thy longer ſtanding, and larger opportunities of being a moſt high proficient in this daily duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thy Meditation <hi>more peculiar and occaſional</hi> (which in a more fignal manner thou ſometimes chuſeſt to exerciſe for thy ſouls refreſhing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement) muſt have a more <hi>accurate management</hi> in thy hand; it ſhould be <hi>a ſingular acting, thy right hand ſhould have her rare cunning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O what work, what <hi>rare ſpiritual</hi> and heavenly work doth the holy Pſalmiſt <hi>David</hi> (<hi>old in this ſo excellent and ſweet way</hi> of Meditation, this his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly <hi>ſet and ſelected</hi> ſolemn Meditation) doth he make of this way of meditating in ſeveral of the Pſalms he hath left us on Record! In his <hi>younger times,</hi> the times when he firſt gave up his heart to God, he ſoon <hi>learnt to excel</hi> in this Art of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He was the <hi>ſweet ſinger of Iſrael,</hi> but withal a rare practitioner of <hi>heavenly Meditation.</hi> Not as the too uſual way of the world, whoſe muſick is oft a rather <hi>memorizing</hi> the Heathen Gods and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes, or that ravels out in meer <hi>wanton fancies,</hi> but keeps not any due bounds, nor hath any right ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency. But <hi>his way and excellency</hi> was <hi>in Pſalms
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:47560:196"/>and Hymns and ſpiritual ſongs, for making melody in his heart to the Lord.</hi> Not for the <hi>Temple</hi> only, but for his <hi>private recreation.</hi> This we have appearing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59. <hi>When Saul ſent, and they watch the houſe to kill him,</hi> mentioned 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.11. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. <hi>When David changed his behaviour before the King of Gath,</hi> mentioned in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.13. Thus <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52. <hi>Of Doegs wickedneſs,</hi> recorded 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.9. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.2. <hi>When David was in the cave,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56. compared with 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.11. On which occaſion alſo the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited 34. Pſalm was made, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. that ſo <hi>rare affectionate</hi> one, and many others, which in his way of <hi>occaſional meditating,</hi> he penned when a very young man. <hi>Six years</hi> he was baniſhed by <hi>Saul,</hi> or thereabout, <hi>forty years</hi> he reigned; was <hi>thirty years</hi> old when he began to reign; therefore he muſt be between twenty four and thirty, a young man, when he <hi>penned</hi> the Pſalms about <hi>Sauls</hi> perſecutions. Thus as he <hi>recreated</hi> himſelf with all ſorts of Muſick, ſo he <hi>rarely improved</hi> it by exerciſing himſelf in a way of holy Meditation, <hi>reduced his Harp, Lute,</hi> and all others to heavenly uſe; ſo after when he made <hi>muſical inſtruments</hi> for publick Worſhip in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>by Gods preſcription,</hi> he <hi>meditated</hi> Pſalms for that Muſick, <hi>aſſiſted</hi> by Gods inſpiration. But as all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long his time he acted Meditation, and by time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled more in it; ſo (pardon this long digreſſion) <hi>he came not ſhort</hi> of his former actings when he was old, yea when very old.</p>
               <p>O what <hi>rare pieces</hi> are thoſe laſt Meditations in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 18. <hi>It hath a twice recording for the more full commending to ſerious conſidering</hi> of all that read the Bible.</p>

               <p>And the next Chapter, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. <hi>When he was to dye;</hi> after all his meditatings and ſongs, we have his <hi>laſt Meditation,</hi> ſet intended Meditation, his <hi>Swan-like ſong,</hi> purpoſely left in the firſt part of that Chapter. He goes not out as a <hi>candle</hi> in a ſtink, but like a <hi>rich perfume</hi> caſt upon fire, in a moſt ſweet and <hi>heavenly rapture.</hi> The beſt wine ſhould be at the laſt.

Laſt works more than firſt, Rev.</hi> 2.19. that is <hi>better</hi> than firſt. The formal Chriſtian in a ſort may do more; the right fruitful Chriſtian does better laſt; not more only in number, but in <hi>weight,</hi> in <hi>intrinſick</hi> inward excellency, a better way, a better wiſdom, warmth, delight, evenneſs, exactneſs in all duties, and this Meditation does become <hi>the old aged fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, their crown of glory is their exceeding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and evidencing of it.</hi>

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:47560:197"/>leſs weight hanging on thee. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Caſting off every weight.</hi> The weakeſt muſt begin to caſt off; the ſtronger muſt have <hi>caſt off more;</hi> the <hi>old Chriſtian</hi> muſt have caſt off <hi>moſt weight,</hi> have moſt ſtrength, therefore may mount up quicker and higher.</p>
               <p>How pure and ſpiritual ſhould thy <hi>ſhort thoughts</hi> be, like <hi>the ſparklings of the pureſt</hi> and ſtrongeſt wine long cloſe kept. Yea, thou ſhouldſt be able to draw with the threefold cord of <hi>daily, occaſional,</hi> and <hi>eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatory</hi> Meditation (theſe interwoven together Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations) draw more ſtrongly off things below, in <hi>fuller diverſions, higher deſpiſings</hi> of all empty vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and draw <hi>more vigorouſly</hi> upward. The ſetting thy affections on things above, thy eminent acting and fixing them, ſhould be by an eminent firſt <hi>uſing and habiting thy ſpirit</hi> to heavenly mindedneſs. The ſtrongeſt, ſteadieſt, and moſt improved affections ariſe from exacter and more earneſt Meditations. The deeper the foundations of thoughts, the higher the ſtories of thy affections mount up.</p>

               <p>IN particular thy Meditation ſhould ſo be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as to the matter of <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>wiſdom,</hi> as to render thee the higheſt Artiſt in thy trade of godlineſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To be full of knowledge above the weaker Chriſtians, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.14. <hi>I am perſwaded you are
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:47560:198"/>full of knowledge.</hi> The young Chriſtian muſt get knowledge; the ſtrong muſt have much more: But the old Chriſtian muſt be very full to be a teacher of others, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To have meditated ſo, as to arrive at <hi>much</hi> wiſdom, to underſtand thy way, and order it beſt.</p>
               <p>A wiſe Chriſtian <hi>is a perſon of great</hi> excellency; it is very highly extolled in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>This <hi>David,</hi> though not preſently, yet attained in time, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.99, 100. <hi>I have more underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then all my teachers: I have more wiſdom then the ancients.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. To have the <hi>richeſt treaſury</hi> of heavenly truths, the <hi>fulleſt ſtores</hi> of precious experiences, Meditation is the greater gatherer of them, and the improver of them on all occaſions.</p>
               <p>It becometh not a Chriſtian of <hi>long ſtanding</hi> to be poor and unfurniſhed of holy experiences.</p>
               <p>The Pſalmiſt we may ſee drawing forth his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, and telling them to others, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.4, 5. <hi>I cryed, and he heard; Pſal.</hi> 18. almoſt all the Pſalm, he puts all the <hi>pearls of deliverances</hi> (experiences that way) on one ſilken thread of this one <hi>Pſalm</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So <hi>Aſaph, Pſal.</hi> 77.6. <hi>I call to remembrance my ſong in the night,</hi> what joy he formerly felt, though now he wanted it: Thus oft the Saints in Scripture. The Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Who hath delivered, and doth;</hi> he had his experiences rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. More peculiarly <hi>your great exerciſe</hi> (which others cannot ſo well reach) is to be much implied in the <hi>deepeſt</hi> Myſteries, the <hi>higheſt points of Faith,</hi> and the <hi>hardeſt matters of practice.</hi> I mean not ſo much ſuch ſorts of difficulties in Divinity, thoſe
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:47560:198"/>which <hi>great skill in the Tongues and Arts will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,</hi> and that muſt have long time, much ſtudy, which the neceſſary occaſions of very many cannot admit, and are not neceſſary for every man to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
               <p>But ſuch <hi>higher matters</hi> of godlineſs, as may more, <hi>Jude</hi> 20. <hi>edifie you in your holy faith,</hi> increaſe your obedience to a more fruitful and exact walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.15. <hi>See ye walk circumſpectly,</hi> accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, or exactly, the word is; thus, the higher con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations of the Nature of God, his Attributes, and Titles, the <hi>Works of God,</hi> Creation and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, his wiſe, righteous, and holy Adminiſtrations and Government.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Government in the whole world, and all things in particular in it to the leaſt circumſtance, the falling of a hair from the head.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Government, and that ſo <hi>rare</hi> and admirable towards the rational creatures; but moſt obſervable <hi>aſtoniſhing</hi> towards his Church and his dear Saints. This, as <hi>ſome of our Divines ſay of Gods Government of the world and matters</hi> in it, is to be <hi>one</hi> of the great Meditations of Chriſtians, that are by the Apoſtle called Fathers, who having obtained formerly much acquaintance with other truths, of more neceſſary uſe for their then rank and ſtanding, now are to <hi>buſie themſelves</hi> in theſe high Myſteries for further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith and Godlineſs.</p>
               <p>The Myſteries in the <hi>two Books of Scripture</hi> and Nature, are the two Tropicks or Lines between which thy Meditation ſhould move and bound, run its courſe, and keep within this compaſs, which is uſeful and ſafe.</p>
               <p>In ſum, let thy Meditation be improved all thou

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſion.</hi> Now this ſo <hi>highly important</hi> duty of holy Meditation, having been as to the nature, kinds, neceſſity, and excellency ſo fully diſcovered and demonſtrated; the great ſinfulneſs of neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it evinced; the dangers following the neglect manifeſted; the practice with ſuch high induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and powerful Scripture-arguments urged home; and the way reſpecting all ſorts of perſons in ſo many Rules and Directions cleared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Application general.</hi> Then <hi>all</hi> who know theſe things are <hi>utterly inexcuſable,</hi> that know theſe ſo greatly neceſſary things, and will not <hi>comply</hi> with the careful practice of them. Ah! therefore <hi>let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one</hi> moſt earneſtly beg it of God, to write <hi>this his Law of holy Meditation in his heart;</hi> to give the <hi>right wiſdom</hi> to underſtand the way of it, the <hi>firm purpoſe</hi> and reſolution conſtantly to perform it, yea, the <hi>practice</hi> of it with ſweeteſt ſolace and higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Let me ſay to my ſoul, <hi>Neceſſity is laid upon me.</hi> It is an <hi>Imperial Law</hi> of the great King of Heaven; if I do it not, great <hi>guilt</hi> will be contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, great <hi>wrath</hi> of a God will be kindled, my ſoul will deeply be <hi>wronged.</hi> If I <hi>have not,</hi> act not <hi>good thoughts,</hi> my heart will <hi>act</hi> evil thoughts, will <hi>fill</hi>
                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:47560:200"/>with evil thoughts, will <hi>fix</hi> and habit it ſelf in them, be <hi>quite</hi> over-run with them.</p>
               <p>I ſhall have a <hi>ſpirit ſtained,</hi> deeply dyed into <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual vanity of mind;</hi> yea, I may be <hi>given up</hi> to judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial penal vanity of thoughts. It may be to <hi>terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> and moſt affrighting thoughts. That I which would not be brought to think of the <hi>threatnings</hi> of a juſt God and his terrible Curſes; That would not meditate of that <hi>greateſt of evils ſin,</hi> of my heart and life-ſins, ſhall have <hi>all my ſins</hi> ſet in order before me, held and kept ſtaring me continually in the face. That <hi>I who would not meditate</hi> of the moſt <hi>bleſſed God,</hi> his <hi>Chriſts fulneſs,</hi> his <hi>Spirits ſweetneſs,</hi> his <hi>Heaven</hi> and everlaſting Happineſs, ſhall <hi>now have</hi> repreſented to my thoughts, and be made <hi>to ſee Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, Hell, and eternal Death continually before me.</hi> Yea, to be under <hi>ſuch amazements and terrours,</hi> to be ſo <hi>haunted</hi> and followed, that at laſt it may be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable,</hi> and quite overwhelm me.</p>
               <p>O therefore let me not ſo ſin againſt my own ſoul, and for ever undo my ſelf by wilful or heedleſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting this duty, which lies ſo indiſpenſibly upon me, and may be ſo advantageous to me!</p>
               <p>O how many are <hi>continually guilty of ſelf-deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for want of a timely ſelf-bethinking?</hi> By a <hi>ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> thinking, for <hi>want of ſerious</hi> thinking? By a <hi>too ſhort thinking,</hi> for want of the neceſſary allowance of time and <hi>ſpace</hi> for thinking? By a <hi>too ſeldom</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not uſing due frequency of thinking? By acting <hi>meer phanſie</hi> and imagination, and not <hi>wiſe conſideration? Adams</hi> firſt ſtate was <hi>good,</hi> yet <hi>muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> but it was not a ſin or imperfection to be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. And though this mutability of his will was a ground of his fall; yet it was his incogitancy was
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:47560:201"/>the <hi>firſt blamable cauſe,</hi> he fell by <hi>acting ſudden, too haſty imagination,</hi> and not <hi>due conſideration, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered not all things to be conſidered.</hi> Thus ever ſince, the falls of ſinners are generally <hi>more by incogitancy, haſte,</hi> and <hi>hurries</hi> of fancy and imagination, want of conſideration (though there be ſins alſo of delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not precipitations, but preſumptions.)</p>
               <p>When God <hi>reduces</hi> a ſinner, he brings him from <hi>ſwaying</hi> phanſie and careleſneſs to conſiderateneſs, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.28. Becauſe he conſiders and turns; he breaks the <hi>reeden Scepter</hi> of phanſie and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and brings in, and ſets up the <hi>golden Scepter</hi> of wiſe conſideration. So <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> Acts 16.30. <hi>Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> But O what <hi>pity</hi> is it that any ſoul ſhould periſh, <hi>for want of a little thinking?</hi> Shall I ſuffer my ſelf to be of that ſimple ſort, and to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away in that crowd to utter ruine? If I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yet walkt in this <hi>heavenly thought-way,</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reaſon <hi>I have to haſten</hi> into it.</p>
               <p>But if I have taſted, tryed, and found the ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſweetneſs and advantages of it, have I not high encouragement to make a farther progreſs ſtill in it?</p>
               <p>And if by <hi>long beating this path,</hi> I have largely experienced the moſt abundant pleaſantneſs and ſweetneſs, have I not then greateſt inducement to go on the more both evenly and earneſtly? Ah! then, my ſoul, conſider with thy ſelf the liberties, the latitudes, the pleaſures, and ſatieties which thy eye may ſtill <hi>expatiate</hi> and recreate it ſelf in, by this rare Art of Divine Meditation.</p>
               <p>Look to thy <hi>ways,</hi> thy <hi>eye-ways,</hi> their varieties and excellencies, which are ſo many, and of that
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:47560:201"/>
                  <hi>tranſcendency,</hi> that there never were, nor can be any ſo <hi>various</hi> and ſpacious, of that delicacy, beauty, and glory.</p>
               <p>The wiſe and holy heart hath far the advantage of all the great Scholars and Artiſts, all the higheſt Nobles and Princes, he hath <hi>better walks</hi> and rarer <hi>eye-entertainments</hi> in his happy way of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Ah! then, my ſoul, how canſt thou in the leaſt ſort be ſlothful and backward to this ſo pleaſant performance, and ſoul-enriching way, this ſo eaſie aſcent to Heaven, by the paths and ſteps purpoſely made thee to mount up thither?</p>
               <p>See what plenties of <hi>rare proviſions</hi> are made to entertain and take up thy thoughts; What multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of fitteſt objects; What ſweet and precious things lie full before thee, to give thee a full em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, at all times, and with a very great variety, to be a <hi>preventive of wearineſs</hi> and cloying, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a more fulneſs of ſatiety and delight.</p>
               <p>Thou haſt that <hi>great Book</hi> of the whole Creation, all the <hi>ſeveral, moſt ſtupendious and glorious</hi> Works of God, to take and look over all the <hi>guilded leaves,</hi> and there to meditate on wonder after wonder.</p>
               <p>Thou mayſt <hi>carry thy eye</hi> over all the Earth full of Gods Riches; deſcend into <hi>the bowels of it,</hi> meet with all the hid Treaſures and Rarities lockt up in the Makers rich Cabinet there below: <hi>Thou mayſt go upon</hi> the ſo large extended Waters, <hi>through the paths of the Seas,</hi> ſee the things of excellency in the one and other. Thence thou <hi>mayſt aſcend up</hi> the ſteps and ſtories of the <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Firmament,</hi> the <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Heaven</hi> beyond it, with the ſo <hi>glorious Lights</hi> of ſuch aſtoniſhing magnitudes and <hi>motions, orders,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:47560:202"/>and influences.</hi> Thence then mount up thou mayſt to the higheſt Heaven, that moſt holy place, the <hi>Worlds</hi> moſt glorious piece and fabrick, that Palace of the King of Glory, with all his ſo glorious Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue and <hi>Attendants</hi> of <hi>millions of millions</hi> of moſt happy Saints and Angels.</p>
               <p>O what an ample proviſion is this for my ſpirits particular help and ſolace, my <hi>eye-accommodation</hi> and recreation? Yea, how unſpeakably gracious muſt I have declared my God to be towards me; had I only been favoured with the ten thouſand part of the things my Meditation can recreate it ſelf upon?</p>
               <p>Ah! but, my ſoul, thou haſt more <hi>graciouſly</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded thee by thy God another book, that richeſt Treaſure of moſt infallible, neceſſary, and ſaving Truths; there may I moſt highly meditate and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate my ſelf with that higheſt Myſtery of godlineſs, all the wonders concurring and meeting to make it up; and among them, that moſt eſpecially of the ſo <hi>aſtoniſhing,</hi> ſo <hi>all-amazing Myſtery of God manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the fleſh.</hi> The very <hi>higheſt thought-walk</hi> given for a created Nature to take <hi>its moſt raviſhing ſolace in.</hi> Not only for ſinners redeemed by the Lord of Glory; but thoſe of <hi>that uppermoſt rank of Nature</hi> that never needed a Saviour from ſin; yet being mutable creatures, might all have fallen. But in Chriſt their Head, being given in their election to him, and thence preſerved by him. Theſe bleſſed Angels have this Myſtery of Godlineſs, this Lord of Glory Jeſus Chriſt, their Head of continuation of happineſs, the moſt tranſcendent object of their higheſt contemplation and admiration.</p>
               <p>O what an account then ſhall I render to my
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:47560:202"/>God, if I do not deſign and endeavour Meditation in ſome good degree <hi>proportionate,</hi> and anſwering the ſo <hi>inconceivable eye-obligation</hi> and engagement herein lying on me.</p>
               <p>But O my ſoul, this is not all, thou haſt yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Book</hi> beſides that of the Creature, and the other of Scripture; the book of thy <hi>own ſelf, ſtate,</hi> and heart, wherein with ſingular advantage thou mayſt conſtantly buſie thy thoughts moſt ſeriouſly. And if thou art Chriſts Temple, knoweſt his dwelling in thee, thou mayſt find it like the ſo glorious Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> built of coſtly ſtones of ſpiritual excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, over-laid with that pure gold of inward Holineſs and Sanctification throughout. Having in it that fire of heavenly love deſcended on it, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it; the <hi>Altar</hi> for offering thy ſelf by Chriſt in thee a whole burnt-offering; the golden Altar Chriſt for <hi>the perfuming of all thy ſervices</hi> to aſcend as Incenſe up to God, and be pleaſing, moſt ſweet, and acceptable with him. There you may <hi>find the golden Lamps</hi> with the ſeven glorious lights, the Lord of light, thy wiſdom, making thee light and ſhining in heavenly knowledge and wiſdom. Nay, there may be found the <hi>golden Ark</hi> with the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, the Law by the finger of Chriſt written on <hi>the fleſhly tables of thy heart,</hi> and the Mercy-ſeat or Propitiatory, whereby thou art made to God a friend by Chriſt who is the Propitiation, reſiding in the Temple, the hidden man of thy heart; the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims of glory cover thee, and thy whole man made the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt dwelling and working in thee.</p>
               <p>O what precious matter of Meditation may thy own glorious ſtate, and the <hi>beauties of Graces</hi> and
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:47560:203"/>Holineſs, the new creature formed in thee, after the image of Chriſt, and the Spirit of life and power, to the higheſt praiſe of the infinite love of the moſt bleſſed God, afford thee; even that God who in riches of free grace hath thought upon, and from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity choſen thee to be a veſſel of glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?</p>
               <p>O how many and many <hi>rare objects,</hi> as have been formerly expreſt, are given and ſet before thee to improve Meditation upon? And to and above all, if there be not enough, large enough, high enough, ſweet enough, and ſatisfying; thou haſt to ſearch and dive farther into the infinite power of the <hi>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient</hi> God, eſpecially his infinite lovelineſs and ſweetneſs, to take thy higheſt ſolace, fulleſt ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in.</p>
               <p>Ah! then my ſoul, lift up to the <hi>utmoſt</hi> thy ſelf in moſt glorious <hi>praiſes</hi> unto thy God, who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſuch a way as this of heavenly Meditation, to <hi>hedge in</hi> thy thoughts, wildneſs, and wandrings; to <hi>help up</hi> thy thought, otherwiſe earthlineſs: <hi>Bleſs him with all that is within thee</hi> for vouchſafing and ſanctifying ſo happy a way for thy both <hi>thought-imployment</hi> and <hi>improvement. Bleſs him</hi> with all <hi>heart-enlargements</hi> thou canſt for making thee ſo <hi>ſpacious and large walks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſt highly rejoyce in him</hi> who hath afforded thee ſo tranſcending, pleaſant, and delightful walks for thy thoughts to <hi>take their happy turns in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Say unto thy God, <hi>O what is man that thou art ſo mindful of him?</hi> ſo <hi>mindful of that ſilly mind of man,</hi> as to <hi>prepare and fit for him</hi> ſuch bleſſed <hi>mind-walks,</hi> and theſe in ſo <hi>great variety of excellency,</hi> ſpiritual excellency for ſuch pure pleaſure, and raviſhing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:47560:203"/>
               <p>O then my ſoul, <hi>never deny</hi> the doing of this work, never <hi>defer the doing</hi> to a better time, when time is now.</p>
               <p>O be not heartleſs and liſtleſs, dead and dull, not uneven and inconſtant in the fervent performance of it.</p>
               <p>O daily contend to <hi>higher excellency</hi> in this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Art, to have <hi>the wings of thy ſpirit</hi> longer and ſtronger, to ſoar <hi>a higher pitch,</hi> to take a more nimble flight, and make <hi>larger returns</hi> of bleſſed advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, in peace, joy, ſatisfactions of raviſhments and higheſt raptures of ſpirit, and by this <hi>aſſent</hi> of holy Meditation, mount up ſtill higher and higher till thou toucheſt Heaven it ſelf, till contemplation ends in viſion and fruition of the moſt infinitely glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God himſelf. Viſion is accompanied with plenary and moſt perfect ſatisfaction, perfect happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for ever. To which moſt <hi>unſpeakably</hi> glorious God, the moſt infinitely <hi>higheſt Beauty</hi> and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency for the eye by contemplation to act and dwell upon; the Father, chiefly in his <hi>infinite riches</hi> of free Grace; the Son, in his <hi>infinite fulneſs</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; the Holy Spirit, in his <hi>moſt glorious</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation and Application of that Redemption, be Honour, Glory, and everlaſting Praiſes of Saints and Angels for ever.
